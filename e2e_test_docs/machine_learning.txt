Machine Learning Basics

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and make decisions without being explicitly programmed. There are three main types of machine learning:

1. Supervised Learning: Uses labeled data to train models. Examples include classification and regression problems.

2. Unsupervised Learning: Finds patterns in data without labeled examples. Clustering and dimensionality reduction are common applications.

3. Reinforcement Learning: Learns through interaction with an environment, receiving rewards or penalties for actions taken.

Applications of machine learning are everywhere today, from recommendation systems in Netflix to autonomous vehicles. The field continues to grow rapidly with advances in deep learning and neural networks.

Key algorithms include linear regression, decision trees, support vector machines, and neural networks. Each has its strengths and is suited for different types of problems.
