# Progress: GraphRAG MCP

## What Works (Core Components)
- Basic FastAPI application structure.
- Abstracted Graph Repository interface.
- Protocol-based service interfaces (e.g., for LLMs).
- Initial test framework setup (`pytest`).
- Core Pydantic models for domain entities.

## What's Left (High-Level Goals)
- **Stability:** Resolve current FastAPI type errors & import/dependency conflicts.
- **Ingestion:** Implement and test the full document processing -> KG building pipeline.
- **Querying:** Implement and test the core GraphRAG query engine logic.
- **Refinement:** Consolidate interfaces (e.g., graph repo), update test configs.
