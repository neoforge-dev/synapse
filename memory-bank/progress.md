# Progress and Status

## Overall Summary
- **Current State:** Config stability improved. Env aliasing added; API import collision resolved. New tests verify settings aliasing and `MemgraphConnectionConfig` defaults. Core engine remains green; `/documents` API tests pass; some API/integration tests still pending fixes.
- **Key Achievement:** Unified settings behavior across app/tests; removed ambiguous settings imports; added guardrail tests.
- **Critical Concern:** Previously blocking Pydantic validation for Memgraph connection is mitigated by alias handling; need to confirm via full test run.

## What Works Well
- **Setup & Core:** Poetry, Config, Pydantic Models.
- **Infrastructure:** `MemgraphGraphRepository` (CRUD tested, SSL mode attribute error fixed, basic empty label handling for nodes and relationships added), `SimpleVectorStore`, `Spacy/MockEntityExtractor`, `Mock/OpenAILLMService` placeholders.
- **Services/Engine:** `IngestionService` (basic flow), `SimpleGraphRAGEngine` (good test coverage for helpers & key scenarios), `PersistentKnowledgeGraphBuilder` (refactored tests for its direct API).
- **API:** FastAPI app, routers, DI via `api/dependencies.py`. Document management (`/api/v1/documents`) endpoint tests are now passing with mocks.
- **Testing:** `pytest` setup; foundational API/Memgraph tests pass. `SimpleGraphRAGEngine` and orchestrator have strong test coverage.

## High-Priority Next Steps (Actionable To-Do List)
1. Run full test suite; confirm new config tests pass and previous validation error is gone.
2. Fix streaming endpoint test (`/api/v1/search/stream`) data shape issue.
3. Standardize DI to mgclient repo; gate/remove legacy client usages to avoid drift.
4. Address remaining API test failures (mocks and DI consistency).

## Other Important Tasks (Post-Critical Path)
- Refine error handling across layers.
- Scalability/performance improvements.
- Deployment strategy.
- Monitoring/logging.
- (Post-MVP) Web UI.

## Key Known Issues & Risks
- **Config drift across envs:** Addressed via alias support; still needs verification in CI.
- **API Test Failures (various):** Several API tests still fail due to:
    - Missing mock methods (e.g., `get_all_documents` on `GraphRepository` mock).
    - Dependency injection issues (e.g., `get_ingestion_service` not defined in test scope).
- **Streaming Endpoint Test:** Fails due to mock data structure mismatch.
- **Low Overall Test Coverage:** Actively being addressed. Skipped tests are a major factor.
- **~45 Skipped Tests:** Investigation complete; primary cause is external dependencies/environment config. Cannot address directly.
- **Tooling Instability:** `edit_file` tool has shown issues with large/complex changes on certain files, blocking specific refactoring tasks.
- **DI Standardization:** Ensure consistent use of `dependencies.py` across all tests.
- **`SimpleGraphRAGEngine._get_graph_context`:** Full error handling logic for `get_neighbors` still unverified due to view limitations.

## Next Steps (Priority Order)
1. Execute tests; fix failures starting with streaming endpoint.
2. Consolidate Memgraph client usage to mgclient repo path in DI.
3. Continue increasing test coverage.

All MemgraphGraphRepository CRUD tests still pass (chunk property persistence fixed previously). 
`tests/api/test_documents.py` remains green after DI and date comparison fixes.
