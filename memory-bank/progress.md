# Progress: GraphRAG MCP (Optimized)

## What Works (Core Concepts)
- Basic FastAPI structure.
- Abstract `GraphStore` interface defined.
- `MemgraphGraphRepository` implements `GraphStore`.
- Core domain models (`Document`, `Chunk`, `Entity`, `Relationship`, `Node`).
- Test framework (`pytest`, async support) in place.

## What's Left / Blocked
- **STABILITY:** Resolve **critical test failures** across all test suites (unit, integration, API, CLI). See `active-context.md` for detailed errors (mocking, dependencies, async, CLI, API, fixtures).
- **Ingestion Pipeline:** Implement/test document processing -> entity extraction -> graph storage flow. Requires stable tests and dependencies.
- **Query Engine:** Implement/test core RAG logic using graph context. Depends on stable ingestion & tests.
