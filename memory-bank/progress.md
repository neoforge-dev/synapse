# Progress and Status

This document tracks project progress, identifies what works, what remains to be built, the overall status, and known issues.

## What Works

*   **Dependency Management:** Poetry setup is complete and managing dependencies.
*   **Configuration:** Centralized configuration (`graph_rag/config.py`) is in place.
*   **Core Models:** Pydantic models for documents, nodes, relationships, chunks are defined.
*   **Memgraph Integration:** `MemgraphGraphRepository` can connect, perform CRUD operations (add, get, delete nodes/relationships), and reconstruct Pydantic models from query results. **Refactored `get_document_by_id`, `get_chunk_by_id`, `get_chunks_by_document_id`, and `add_chunk` to correctly handle `mgclient.Node.properties` access, use the correct relationship (`CONTAINS`), and improve error handling.**
*   **Vector Store:** `SimpleVectorStore` provides basic add/search functionality with locking.
*   **Dependency Injection:** Centralized factories and cache in `graph_rag/api/dependencies.py` handle component instantiation.
*   **API Structure:** FastAPI application (`main.py`) with routers for ingestion, query, debug is set up.
*   **Lifespan Management:** Basic startup/shutdown logic for initializing/closing resources (like graph store connection) is implemented.
*   **Basic Ingestion:** `IngestionService` orchestrates chunking and adding to graph/vector stores.
*   **Basic Query:** `GraphRAGEngine` structure exists, though end-to-end query flow needs validation.
*   **Debugging Tools:** `GraphDebugger` can execute Cypher queries and return raw results.

## What's Left to Build / Fix

*   **End-to-End Testing:** Comprehensive integration tests covering the full ingestion and query pipelines.
*   **Query Pipeline Logic:** Thoroughly test and potentially refine the logic within `GraphRAGEngine`, including vector search, graph retrieval, and LLM interaction.
*   **LLM Integration:** Ensure the LLM component (`LlamaCppLLMService` or alternatives) integrates correctly for response synthesis.
*   **Error Handling:** Robust error handling throughout the API and core components.
*   **Scalability & Performance:** Optimize queries, potentially add indexing in Memgraph, evaluate vector store performance.
*   **Deployment:** Define deployment strategy (e.g., Docker, K8s).
*   **Monitoring & Logging:** Implement proper logging and potentially monitoring.
*   **Test Coverage:** Increase unit and integration test coverage significantly.

## Current Status

*   **Core Engine (`SimpleGraphRAGEngine`)**: Basic implementation exists. Tests partially fixed, but some skipped.
*   **Knowledge Graph Builder (`SimpleKnowledgeGraphBuilder`)**: Basic implementation exists.
*   **Graph Store (`MemgraphGraphRepository`)**: Implementation refactored to handle `mgclient` node properties correctly. Basic tests passing.
*   **Vector Store (`SimpleVectorStore`)**: Basic implementation exists. **The bug causing unnecessary embedding regeneration in `ingest_chunks` has been fixed.** Test coverage remains low.
*   **Entity Extractor (`SpacyEntityExtractor`, `MockEntityExtractor`)**: Implementations exist.
*   **LLM Service (`MockLLMService`, `OpenAILLMService`)**: Basic mocks and placeholders exist.
*   **API (`FastAPI`)**: Routers for ingestion, search, documents, chunks exist. Dependency injection uses singletons (mostly).
    - `/api/v1/ingestion/documents`: Accepts requests, runs background tasks. Integration test fixed.
    - `/api/v1/search/`, `/api/v1/search/batch`, `/api/v1/search/query`: Endpoints exist. Unit/Integration tests passing (using mocks or fixed singleton access).
*   **Tests**:
    - `tests/api/test_search_ingestion.py`: All tests now passing after fixing singleton dependency issue.
    - `tests/core/test_graph_rag_engine.py`: Partially fixed, some tests skipped.
    - `tests/core/test_graph_rag_engine_orchestrator.py`: Fixed.
    - Overall coverage is **very low (33%)**.
*   **Memory Bank**: Core files exist.

## Completed & Working

*   **Core:** Domain models, graph/vector store interfaces, Memgraph DB connection framework.
*   **Infrastructure:**
    - `MemgraphGraphRepository`: Implemented and passing integration tests.
    - `SimpleVectorStore`: Implemented (in-memory, sentence-transformers `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`, cosine similarity). *Consolidated duplicate implementations*.
*   **API/App:** FastAPI structure setup, initial endpoints defined.
*   **Fixes:**
    - Resolved `IngestionService` init params, LLM_TYPE handling, Memgraph chunk property persistence issues.
    - Fixed CLI ingest command tests in `tests/integration/test_ingest_command.py` by updating the repository type to use `MemgraphGraphRepository` instead of `MemgraphRepository`.
    - Resolved Memgraph client property access issue (`mgclient.Node` vs `dict`) by refactoring `MemgraphGraphRepository` methods.
    - **Fixed redundant embedding generation in `SimpleVectorStore.ingest_chunks`.**
    - Resolved import errors and dependency issues in `tests/api/test_search_ingestion.py`.
*   **Tests:**
    - Query pipeline integration tests (`tests/integration/test_query_pipeline.py`) are now passing (using mocked engine).
    - CLI ingest command tests (`tests/integration/test_ingest_command.py`) are now passing.
    - API tests in `tests/api/test_search_ingestion.py` are now passing.

## What's Left / Needs Doing (Priority Order)

1.  **Address Low Test Coverage (High Priority)**: Add unit and integration tests for API routers, services, core engine logic, document processing, entity extraction, graph building, storage interactions, and error handling.
2.  **Fix/Unskip Remaining Core Engine Tests**: Address issues in `tests/core/test_graph_rag_engine.py`.
3.  **Implement Core Logic**: Build out the main orchestration logic in `GraphRAGEngine` or services (query planning, context building, graph traversal, answer synthesis).
4.  **Implement Real Services**: Flesh out `LLMService`, potentially add other `VectorStore` or `EntityExtractor` implementations.
5.  **Refine Error Handling**: Improve error handling across API and services.
6.  **Review Skipped Tests**: Address skipped tests in other suites (e.g., E2E MVP).
7.  **Scalability & Performance**: Evaluate and optimize performance, especially for large datasets and complex graph queries.
8.  **Deployment:** Define deployment strategy (e.g., Docker, K8s).
9.  **Monitoring & Logging:** Implement proper logging and potentially monitoring.

## Known Issues / Bugs

*   **Low Test Coverage (33%)**: Major risk. Requires significant improvement across all components. Critical for identifying regressions and ensuring stability.
*   Potential inconsistencies if services are ever initialized *without* using the singleton getters (e.g., direct instantiation).
*   Some tests in `tests/core/test_graph_rag_engine.py` are still skipped or failing.

## Next Steps (Priority Order)
1.  **Fix `ModuleNotFoundError` in `graph_rag/core/graph_rag_engine.py`.**
2.  Verify status of other test suites (CLI, Memgraph store, Entity Extractor).
3.  Increase Test Coverage significantly.
4.  Implement and fix NLP integration tests.
5.  Implement Ingestion Pipeline core logic.
6.  Implement Query Engine core logic.
7.  (Post-MVP) Begin Web UI implementation.

All MemgraphGraphRepository CRUD tests now pass after fixing chunk property persistence (id/document_id always set).
