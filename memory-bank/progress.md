# Progress

## What Works
- Basic FastAPI application structure
- Graph repository interface
- Protocol-based service interfaces
- Test framework setup

## What's Left to Build
- Fix FastAPI response model type errors
- Resolve import and dependency issues
- Consolidate graph repository interfaces
- Update test configurations

## Current Status
- Working on fixing dependency and import issues
- Addressing FastAPI response model type errors
- Updating settings and configurations

## Known Issues
1. FastAPI response model type errors in query router
2. Inconsistent type annotations between interfaces and implementations
3. Duplicate test files causing import conflicts
4. Missing or incorrect settings references in various modules

## Next Steps
1. Fix FastAPI response model type errors
2. Resolve remaining import issues
3. Update test configurations
4. Consolidate graph repository interfaces

## Recent Changes
- Added missing API settings
- Created LLM protocols and types
- Updated Memgraph client imports
- Fixed settings references
