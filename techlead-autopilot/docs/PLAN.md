# TechLead AutoPilot - Next 4 Epics Development Plan

## First Principles Analysis

**Current State**: Sophisticated backend system (85% complete) with comprehensive business logic, multi-tenant architecture, and proven €290K content generation algorithms. **Critical Gap**: No frontend interface and incomplete external integrations.

**Fundamental Business Requirements**:
1. **Users must be able to interact with the system** → Need complete UI
2. **Business must generate revenue** → Need billing and subscription management
3. **Core value proposition must be delivered** → Need LinkedIn automation completion
4. **Users must be able to discover and adopt** → Need complete user journey

## Epic Prioritization Strategy

**Priority Framework**: Business Impact × User Value × Technical Risk
- **Epic 1**: Highest business impact (makes product usable)
- **Epic 2**: Core value delivery (LinkedIn automation)
- **Epic 3**: Revenue enablement (customer acquisition)
- **Epic 4**: Value completion (lead detection)
