## 💡 **First Principles Approach**

### **Fundamental Business Truth**
Technical consultants generated €290K in consultation pipeline by consistently posting optimized LinkedIn content at proven times (6:30 AM Tue/Thu) with high-quality, engagement-focused content.

### **Essential User Journey**
User Connects LinkedIn → Content Generated → Content Scheduled → Posted Automatically → Engagement Tracked → Leads Detected

### **Critical Success Factors**
1. **Reliability**: 99%+ posting success rate - failures lose business opportunities
2. **Timing**: Exact 6:30 AM Tue/Thu posting - timing drives engagement
3. **Quality**: Content maintains proven templates - quality drives lead generation
4. **Automation**: Zero manual intervention - automation enables scalability

### **Technical Constraints**
- LinkedIn API rate limits (300 posts/day, 500 API requests/day)
- OAuth token expiration (60 days, requires refresh)
- Time zone complexity for global users
- Mobile network reliability for approval workflow
