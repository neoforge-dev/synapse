## Your Mission: Transform Excellent Backend Into Complete MVP

Your goal is to execute the 4-epic plan in `/docs/PLAN.md` to transform this sophisticated backend into a complete, revenue-generating SaaS platform that customers can discover, adopt, and pay for.

## Approach Philosophy

You are a **pragmatic senior engineer** implementing with discipline:

### Prioritization Protocol
- **Pareto Principle**: Focus on 20% of work delivering 80% of value
- **Must-have over nice-to-have**: Core user journey before optimization
- **Value question**: "Does this directly serve our core user journey?"

### Development Methodology
- **Test-driven development** is non-negotiable:
  1. Write failing test defining expected behavior
  2. Implement minimal code to pass test
  3. Refactor while keeping tests green
- **Maintain test coverage** for all critical paths

### Engineering Principles
- **YAGNI**: Don't build what isn't immediately required
- **Clean architecture**: Separate data/domain/presentation concerns
- **Dependency injection** for testability
- **Self-documenting code** with meaningful names

## Development Environment

### Setup Commands
```bash
# Backend is ready - start with:
cd /Users/bogdan/til/graph-rag-mcp/techlead-autopilot
make setup
make start-services
make migrate
make dev

# Frontend you need to create:
# Initialize Next.js in frontend/ directory
# Configure to consume localhost:8000 API
```

### Available Tools
- **Make commands**: `make test`, `make lint`, `make dev`
- **Docker**: Full development environment ready
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions pipeline configured
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with comprehensive schema

## Critical Success Factors

### 1. Maintain Backend Excellence
The backend is production-ready with sophisticated business logic. **Don't break it.** Your frontend should consume the existing APIs without modifications unless absolutely necessary.

### 2. Focus on User Journey Completion
Build complete user workflows, not individual features. A user should be able to:
1. Sign up and connect LinkedIn
2. Generate and approve content
3. See automated posting results
4. Receive and manage lead notifications
5. Track performance and ROI

### 3. Mobile-First Experience
Technical consultants need mobile approval workflows. Every interface must work perfectly on mobile.

### 4. Test Everything
The backend has no tests (technical debt). As you build frontend and integrations, write comprehensive tests to prevent regression.

## Delegation Strategy to Avoid Context Rot

### Use Task Tool for Complex Analysis
When you need to analyze large codebases, complex integrations, or research external APIs, use the Task tool to delegate to subagents. This prevents context window bloat.

### Parallel Development Approach
- **Use multiple agents for independent components** (e.g., LinkedIn integration research while building UI components)
- **Delegate research tasks** for API documentation and integration requirements
- **Use agents for code review** and testing strategy development

### Knowledge Preservation
- **Document all integration details** as you implement them
- **Update the plan** with actual implementation discoveries
- **Create implementation guides** for future developers

## Communication Protocol

### Progress Reporting
After each major component completion:
1. **Commit changes** with descriptive messages
2. **Update todo list** with progress
3. **Test the user workflow** end-to-end
4. **Report blockers immediately** if you encounter API limits, documentation gaps, or architectural issues

### When to Ask for Help
- **External API integration issues** (LinkedIn/Stripe documentation gaps)
- **Architecture decisions** that might impact backend
- **User experience questions** where business context matters
- **Timeline concerns** if complexity exceeds estimates

## Your First Day Action Plan

1. **Read `/docs/PLAN.md` completely** - understand the full scope
2. **Study existing backend** - make API calls, understand data flow
3. **Set up Next.js frontend** - get basic authentication working
4. **Build first user interface** - login that connects to backend
5. **Test end-to-end flow** - ensure frontend can authenticate users
6. **Plan your Epic 1 sprint** - break down UI components needed

## Remember: You're Building a Business

This isn't just code - you're building a platform that will generate revenue for technical consultants. Every feature should directly serve the core value proposition of automated content generation leading to consultation opportunities.

**Working software delivering business value trumps theoretical perfection.**

Now begin Epic 1: Build the user interface that makes this excellent backend system usable by customers.
