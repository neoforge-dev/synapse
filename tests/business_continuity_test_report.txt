RECOMMENDATIONS
----------------------------------------
‚ùå RECOMMENDATION: DO NOT PROCEED WITH MIGRATION

Critical Issues Must Be Resolved:
1. Address all test failures before migration
2. Validate consultation pipeline protection mechanisms
3. Ensure rollback procedures are fully functional
4. Re-run comprehensive test suite until 100% success

Business Risk Mitigation:
1. Maintain current SQLite system until all tests pass
2. Protect $555K consultation pipeline at all costs
3. Do not proceed without unanimous test approval
4. Consider phased migration approach if issues persist
