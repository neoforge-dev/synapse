**Context**: John, based on my experience, once the team starts to grow, individual developer preferences become more apparent. Using JS/TS on both the front end and backend may not matter as much because developers tend to have their preferences. Nonetheless, the crucial domain logic resides in the backend, and any duplicated code primarily pertains to validation. Programming languages are tools, and the key is to use the right tool for the job without overcomplicating things.

### 85. there’s more depth to these ‘why’ questions than meets the eye

**Date**: 2023-11-15
**Engagement**: 0.000%

**Context**: I believe there’s more depth to these ‘why’ questions than meets the eye. Often, a coach brings to the table experiences, either direct or indirect, that relate to the situation at hand. The power of thinking outside the box cannot be understated, and this is likely why techniques like rubber duck debugging prove to be effective.

### 86. there are scenarios where using an ORM does make sense

**Date**: 2023-10-26
**Engagement**: 0.000%

**Context**: Mike, you make a solid point about the pitfalls of tight coupling and the value of understanding SQL. However, I think there are scenarios where using an ORM does make sense. For instance, in the Django world, the ORM streamlines a lot of tasks and reduces boilerplate code, allowing you to focus on business logic. So, while ORMs aren't a silver bullet and knowing SQL is unquestionably beneficial, they can offer efficiency and quick development in the right context.

### 88. the results might be biased

**Date**: 2023-10-12
**Engagement**: 0.000%

**Context**: Alex, this was an interesting read, but I believe the results might be biased. Here are my thoughts on this: In September, you already had a +25% increase in followers compared to August. It's worth noting that August is a known month for low engagement on LinkedIn due to holidays. For more statistically accurate results, consider excluding outliers (posts that receive significantly more engagement than usual). I've experimented quite a bit with posting once vs. twice daily for my audience. It turns out that I got slightly more impressions when posting twice, but only when I could actively engage with other creators before and after posting. However, this can be quite time-consuming.

If you want to speed up the process, a mentor from your domain is the most useful as he can offer feedback and also strategies on how to develop your soft skills.
