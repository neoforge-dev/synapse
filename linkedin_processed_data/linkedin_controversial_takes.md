Are Your Product Management Practices Holding You Back? Having navigated the realms of both coding and product management, I wanted to shed some light on a few common pitfalls in product management that I've seen (and admittedly, made myself) and share some tips on how to avoid them. 1. Thinking It's All About the Tech: As tech professionals, we often love getting lost in the world of technology. But as a product manager, you also need to think about business goals, user needs, and the market landscape. Make sure you're balancing your love for technology with a comprehensive understanding of the bigger picture. 2. Ignoring Feedback: One of the foundations of effective product management is continuous learning. Listen to your customers, your team, and the market. Learn, adapt, iterate - it's a never-ending cycle. 3. Skipping Validation: Many professionals dive headfirst into building a product without validating the idea first. Remember the Lean Startup principles: Build-Measure-Learn. Validate your assumptions before you invest significant resources into building a product. 4. Not Prioritizing: Everything cannot be a priority. You need to make tough decisions about what features to build and in what order. Use prioritization frameworks like RICE or MoSCoW to help make these decisions. 5. Losing Focus on the User: It's easy to get caught up in business goals and technical constraints, but at the end of the day, your product should solve a problem for the user. Keep the user at the center of all decisions. 6. Overlooking Communication: Communication is a key skill for product managers. You need to communicate effectively with stakeholders, your team, and users. Practice transparency and clarity in your communication. As tech professionals, it would be beneficial to have a better understanding of the challenges in product management and the pains that founders face when managing their product. It's normal to make mistakes, so I hope these pointers will help you anticipate and avoid common pitfalls. Have you experienced any of these pitfalls? Do you have other common mistakes to add to the list? Please drop a comment below. üëá #productmanagement #techprofessionals #productdevelopment #startupgrowth #techleadership #softwaredevelopment

Stuck with your startup? The key is to tackle your major challenge. + Identify your main obstacle: Could be tech, market fit, or team problems. + Address it: This can stimulate growth in other areas. In tech, speed and flexibility are vital. Fixing your main problem not only solves the current issues but also makes room for future improvements. 5 simple yet effective strategies often overlooked for your consideration: 1. Reverse problem-solving: ‚Ü≥ Think about where you want to be, then plan your steps in reverse. This way, you may find unusual steps that you might not notice with straight thinking. 2. User shadowing: ‚Ü≥ Spend a day watching your customers use your product in their usual setting. You can learn things this way that you can't from just looking at data. 3. Cross-industry inspiration: ‚Ü≥ Search for answers in industries that aren't like yours. Sometimes, the solution you need has been found in a totally different area. 4. Micro-experiments: ‚Ü≥ Divide your big task into smaller parts and try easy, cheap tests. This can help find the best solution without spending a lot at the start. 5. Pre-mortem analysis: ‚Ü≥ Before you start your plan, think about what could go wrong. This can help you make backup plans and spot problems before they happen. These strategies will also help fostering a culture of innovation and resilience. By looking at your challenge from different angles and applying these lesser-known tactics, you can unlock progress in ways you hadn't imagined. ‚Üí What's that one challenge for you? How are you planning to tackle it? P.S. Repost if this is useful ‚ôªÔ∏è

A few days ago, I shared my transformative journey from being a software engineer generalist to becoming a Python backend developer, along with my top 10 book recommendations that fueled my growth. Your response was overwhelming, and I am deeply grateful for your support and engagement! Reflecting on our recent exchange about my journey as a Python backend developer and the books that shaped my path, I couldn't help but be inspired by the shared insights and personal stories in the comments section. Here are some key takeaways that enriched our discussion: 1. Python's ecosystem is expansive, not just about the language itself, but how it fits into the broader tech ecosystem. Python's compatibility with low-level languages like C++ is a game-changer. 2. Domain-Driven Design (DDD) has its place in Python, albeit not as prevalent as in other languages. Django can, for example, follow a DDD approach. Thanks, Alexandre Poitevin, for this thought-provoking point. 3. The importance of continuous learning cannot be overstated in our rapidly evolving tech world. Books, online resources, and communities like ours are invaluable in our learning journeys. Okare Shaba, thanks for your profound question! 4. Leveraging libraries like Numpy and Dask can optimize execution speed, enriching Python's potential for high-performance computing. John Crickett, your story truly demonstrates this power! 5. The value of mentorship and community shines bright in our discussions. As Paul-Sebastian Manole mentioned, connecting with like-minded individuals and finding mentors can significantly accelerate your growth. 6. Clean Code: While tools like SonarQube and Flake8 assist us, the satisfaction of writing clean, efficient, and functional code is unmatched. Thanks, Sourya Bhattacharya and Paul-Sebastian Manole for the enlightening conversation! Bonus: 7. Type Checking and Data Validation: Pydantic, has revolutionized the way we handle data validation and settings management in Python. Embracing these modern libraries can enhance code reliability and reduce runtime errors, leading to more robust applications. 8. The Zen of Python: Python's guiding principles, known as PEP 20 or "The Zen of Python," encapsulate wisdom that goes beyond just Python programming. It reminds us to prioritize simplicity, readability, and the "one right way" to do things. It's something every Pythonista should embrace, as it can guide us in making better design and code decisions. 9. Asynchronous Programming: With Python's async capabilities, we can create more efficient applications, especially when dealing with I/O bound tasks. This is an area where Python really shines, and understanding the asyncio library can be a huge advantage in today's world of real-time web applications. What has been the most challenging aspect of your Python journey, and how did you overcome it?üëá #python #backenddevelopment #continuouslearning #webdevelopment #softwaredevelopment

Today, let's debunk a myth: When you're facing pressure to scale your product and development team, it's important to recognise that microservices might not be the best solution for you. Trust me, I've learned this the hard way. Why you might want to pump the brakes on microservices: + Startup struggles ‚Ü≥ if you're a startup, the overhead of managing multiple services can be a nightmare + Complexity overhead ‚Ü≥ your team will have to handle intricate orchestration, network latency, and data consistency + The trade-offs ‚Ü≥ you might gain in scalability but lose in tech flexibility Microservices might offer scalability but remember, they come with their own set of complexities. On the flip side, modular monoliths offer a simpler approach, especially beneficial for startups and smaller teams. Why you should consider using modular monoliths: + Decoupling done right ‚Ü≥ you can decouple modules using message queues, creating a well-defined boundary without the complexity of microservices + Flexibility ‚Ü≥ provides the ease to transition into microservices when you're ready to scale +Clean and maintainable ‚Ü≥ by using Clean Architecture and DDD, modular monoliths can be a joy to work with In one of my recent endeavors, opting for a modular monolith over microservices helped us cut down development time by 30-40%. Plus, the application's performance was beyond what we initially aimed for. Whether it's microservices or modular monoliths, your choice will have long-term consequences on project scalability, maintainability, and performance. So choose wisely. Your turn: Are you team microservices or do you lean towards modular monoliths? P.S. Have you ever chosen the wrong architecture and lived to tell the tale? P.S.S.

Many developers misunderstand FastAPI's core advantages and limitations. Confused about why FastAPI might not be the silver bullet it's often sold as? Discover the common misconceptions that might be clouding your understanding of what FastAPI truly offers. FastAPI is robust, but it's not without its intricate details that might render it less than perfect for every undertaking. Let's debunk some FastAPI illusions: It's not just speed: FastAPI's structural decisions offer more than just turbocharged performance. The scalability myth: Contrary to popular belief, "auto-scaling" isn't a FastAPI feature. Thoughtful execution is key. The learning curve fallacy: Behind FastAPI‚Äôs outward simplicity lies deep-rooted asynchronous fundamentals that demand understanding. FastAPI is a potent tool, but like all technologies, it requires comprehensive understanding of its full range of strengths and weaknesses to truly harness its power. -> So, did you find a steeper climb up FastAPI's learning curve than anticipated? Or did you stumble upon benefits that took you by surprise?

A Chief Technology Officer (CTO) with technical skills can be appealing to both startups and established businesses. However, having technical expertise alone is not enough to excel in this role. Here's why: + Focus on tech, not business objectives ‚Ü≥ A CTO engrossed in the latest tech may lose sight of your core business goals. The result? A product that's technically sound but doesn't solve the market needs. + Limited strategic vision ‚Ü≥ Tech skills don't equal business strategy. Without a strategic vision, even the best tech stack can't save a failing business model. + Communication breakdown ‚Ü≥ A tech-first CTO might struggle to communicate complex issues to a non-technical audience, creating a disconnect between departments. + Lacking leadership skills ‚Ü≥ Managing a project and leading a team require different skill sets. Leadership gaps can lead to low morale and high turnover. + Risk of overengineering ‚Ü≥ A tech-focused approach can result in overcomplicated solutions that are expensive to maintain and hard to scale. + Missed market opportunities ‚Ü≥ Being too inward-focused can make you miss shifts in the market, limiting your ability to pivot or capitalize on new opportunities. + Poor prioritization ‚Ü≥ Without a balanced viewpoint, you risk prioritizing less impactful projects, wasting time and resources that could be better used. A fractional CTO should be a strategic partner, not just a tech wizard. They need to align technological solutions with business outcomes. As someone who helps businesses navigate this complex landscape, I find the most successful CTOs are those who can wear both hats effectively. ‚Üí Got thoughts on what makes a CTO truly effective? P.S. If your startup needs someone who can balance technical skills with strategic acumen, send me a DM with the word "strategic".

Overwhelmed by tech stack complexities? Discover how your startup can triumph through simplicity! As entrepreneurs, we're often dazzled by advanced technologies. But, the truth can be brutal - they can tangle your tech stack into a Gordian knot of complexity, and stifle your startup's progress. Your high-tech sophistication must be balanced with the elegance of simplicity. Let's not be seduced into replicating Facebook's technology for your startup's success. Let's prioritize the basics, and watch how simplicity in tech fuels your startup's growth. 1. Frontend Complexity: Strive for simplicity. A fancy UI is a plus, but not at the cost of speed and user experience. Think of your users first. 2. Backend Complexity: Beware of the allure of microservices. They can bog you down in the beginning. Start mono, go micro as you grow. 3. Progressive Web Apps (PWAs): Ditch multiple mobile apps. PWAs promise a seamless user experience across devices. Create once, deploy everywhere. 4. Static, Separated Frontend: Choose simplicity and security. A static frontend boosts performance, minimizes security hazards, and scales effortlessly. 5. Cloud-Native Solutions: Embrace the cloud revolution. Ditch conventional DevOps teams for a DevOps mindset. Less work, more scalability, and infinite flexibility. Complexity is the quicksand of efficiency. Whereas simplicity, paired with cloud-native solutions, paves the way for rapid iterations, smooth scaling, and ultimately, your product's success. The aim? A tech stack that fuels your vision, not one that becomes a project in itself. The goal is to build a technology stack that supports your vision without becoming a project of its own. üëâ Agree? Disagree? What's been your experience with tech stack complexities? üéØ For more insights, check out my Substack: strategictech.substack_com

Every startup faces the decision: Containers or Serverless? It's not just a tech choice, but a strategic one that can impact your startup's agility and scale. Let's break it down: üê≥Containers - The "Pack 'n' Play" Approach: - Best For: Apps that require specific environments, or when you need more control and flexibility. - Action Step: Assess your team's expertise and capacity to handle orchestration tools like Kubernetes. The learning curve can be steep but the control is unparalleled. ‚òÅ Serverless - The "Focus on Code" Approach: - Best For: Rapid deployment, intermittent workloads, or when you want to fully utilize the 'pay-as-you-use' model. - Action Step: Consider the frequency and predictability of your workloads. High, variable traffic can lead to unpredictable costs in a serverless architecture. The decision is unique to your startup, based on your resources, your app's needs, and the predictability of your workloads. Transitioning between the two isn't a one-click operation, so plan ahead. Start small, test the waters, and iterate based on experience and feedback. It can be tough to decide. That's why I'm offering a free consultation to startups in the EMEA region (link from the comments). I'll help you weigh the pros and cons relative to your unique circumstances and long-term goals. Book your slot now. Limited spots available for this month. Don't miss out on this opportunity to get strategic guidance tailored to your startup's needs. Startups out there, how are you navigating this decision? Let's discuss. Feel free to share your experiences and the factors influencing your choice. Together, we learn and grow. üëá #startupgrowth #cloudcomputing #techleadership #softwaredevelopment #codeswiftr

Many software engineers perceive mastering Command Line Interface (CLI) tools as: ‚Üí Reading documentation ‚Üí Practicing commands occasionally ‚Üí Using them only when necessary While these aspects are part of the learning curve, they don't capture the full power of CLI mastery. Here's a straightforward perspective of what CLI mastery could mean for a developer: CLI Mastery = How you: 1. Understand its tools 2. Implement them regularly 3. Innovate with them Three years ago, I made a deliberate effort to become proficient in CLI tools, and the boost in productivity has been remarkable. The essential CLI tools, such as cat, echo, sed, and grep, among others, each with its unique purpose, have empowered me to tackle even the most challenging projects with confidence. However, mastering CLI is not a solo journey. Insights and experiences from the community have been invaluable. Tools like 'curl' for HTTP requests, 'jq' to format JSON responses, and learning regular expressions were mentioned as additional game-changers by fellow engineers. This brings me to a realization - our shared wisdom can significantly contribute to each other's growth and productivity. So, let me ask you - what CLI tools or practices have made a significant impact on your efficiency as a developer? Are you covering the 3 steps to CLI mastery? If not, it might be time to rethink your strategy and start a deliberate practice regime today. #cli #productivityboost #softwaredevelopment #productivity #linux #unix #terminal

Ever wonder why startups quickly adopt no-code platforms like Bubble_io? You're scaling, but suddenly your no-code solution isn't scaling with you. Learn why the quick fix could turn into a long-term headache: Bubble_io is a no-code platform that allows startups to build web applications without needing to code. It promises a quick-to-market strategy, but let's scratch beneath the surface. + Immediate gratification but at what cost? ‚Ü≥ No-code platforms offer fast deployment but often lack the architecture needed for scalability and security. + Data limitations ‚Ü≥ If your business model depends on intricate data analytics or machine learning, you'll quickly hit the wall with no-code platforms' limited data capabilities. + Lack of customization ‚Ü≥ Your business isn't generic; your tech stack shouldn't be either. No-code solutions can limit your ability to customize, affecting both user experience and operational efficiency. + Vendor lock-in ‚Ü≥ The more your business intertwines with a specific platform, the more painful (and costly) it becomes to untangle yourself later on. + Scalability concerns ‚Ü≥ These platforms may suffice for an MVP but often lack the robustness needed for scaling businesses, leading to performance issues. + Hidden costs ‚Ü≥ The initial cost-saving benefits can evaporate quickly as you find yourself needing add-ons, premium features, or a more advanced and customizable solution. + Technical debt ‚Ü≥ Opting for the quickest solution now can saddle you with a heap of technical problems later, making any future transitions or systems integration more complex and costly. If you've faced or are anticipating any of these issues, what steps are you considering to avoid the Bubble trap?

Fed up with complex GUIs for managing cloud providers (I'm looking at you, AWS üòÖ)? You‚Äôre not alone. After navigating various cloud systems for a few years, I discovered that Terraform is the ultimate tool for simplifying cloud management. Here‚Äôs why: 1. Code-Based Setup: Imagine writing out your entire system setup as code. With Terraform, you can! This means you can effortlessly recreate it anytime‚Äîno more tedious point-and-click interfaces. 2. Works with Multiple Providers: Write your setup once and use it across AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure. No more being locked into a single provider. 3. Easy to Track Changes: Terraform allows you to save different versions of your setup, akin to saving document versions. This makes reverting changes or collaborating with your team a breeze. But here‚Äôs the kicker: While Terraform simplifies setup, command-line tools (CLI) are indispensable for troubleshooting and monitoring. They provide quick insights without the hassle of complex graphical interfaces. Combining Terraform for setup with CLI tools for maintenance transforms cloud system management into a streamlined, strategic advantage. üëá Agree? Disagree? How are you handling your infrastructure today?

Navigating the minefield of tech stack decisions? Let's talk real talk. You've got your MVP, some traction, and a vision. But the tech stack? That's an evolving beast, and wrong moves here can cost you‚Äîbig time. Here are some lesser-discussed gotchas: 1. Scalability gaps Growth is on the horizon, but can your stack handle it? The last thing you want is to hit a wall when your user base spikes. Future-proof your tech choices; think microservices, serverless architecture, or whatever aligns with your scale game. 2. Tech debt: the silent killer Clean codebase? Sure, but tech debt accumulates like compound interest, and trust me, you don't want to pay that debt when you're trying to scale or exit. Keep your codebase lean and mean. PR reviews, static analysis, refactoring‚Äîmake these your regular pit stops. 3. The 'Bling' trap Those shiny, high-end solutions? They're cool, but do you need them right now? More often than not, a lean, open-source library will do the job. Save the cash for scaling your customer acquisition. ‚Üí Deep dive: + Vendor stranglehold Vendor lock-in is no joke. Especially when you're tied to a PaaS or a proprietary database. Keep your options open; otherwise, you'll pay a 'freedom tax' to switch later. + Compliance maze GDPR, CCPA‚Äîthese aren't just buzzwords; they're compliance standards. Get them wrong, and you're not just looking at fines; you're risking brand damage. + Skills mismatch Your devs need to vibe with your stack. If they're spending more time on Stack Overflow than on your repo, you've got a problem. Keep the team's skills in sync with your tech choices. + Community drought Working with a tech stack that's a ghost town in terms of community support is setting yourself up for failure. Open-source contributions, active forums, and solid docs are more than nice-to-haves; they're essentials. Got more wisdom to share or lessons learned the hard way? P.S. The best tech stack errors are the ones you don't make. Learn from each other.

Understanding Python's Black Formatter Let's demystify Python's "Uncompromising Code Formatter" - Black! What's Black All About? Black has one mission: consistent code formatting. It's like that one friend who's super particular but makes sure everything's in order. Black's Key Features: + Line Length: Defaults to 88 characters, beyond PEP 8's 79. + Quotes: Consistently chooses double (") over single ('). + Slicing: Introduces spaces, e.g., a[1:10:2] to a[ 1 : 10 : 2 ]. + Commas: Prefers trailing commas for multi-lines. + Limited Configuration: Embraces minimalism, allowing fewer tweaks. Black aims to eliminate trivial code-style debates in code reviews, ensuring a consistent style across projects. It's about streamlining codebases and reducing friction in team collaboration. What's your stance on Black? A tool that brings peace or just another opinion in your toolkit? P.S.

If you are working on a modular monolith, consider using caching before considering migrating to microservices. Caching is a frequently overlooked feature that can significantly improve performance. Incorporating caching mechanisms can dramatically improve the performance and user experience of your application. The idea is simple: store the results of expensive function calls and return the cached result when the same inputs occur again. + Local and Distributed Cache ‚Ü≥ Depending on the needs, you can opt for local cache mechanisms or go for a more distributed approach using solutions like Redis. + Cache Eviction Policies ‚Ü≥ Deciding when to remove data from the cache is as crucial as deciding what to put in. LRU (Least Recently Used) and LFU (Least Frequently Used) are some commonly used policies. + Data Integrity ‚Ü≥ Cache mechanisms must be designed to maintain data integrity, especially in scenarios involving multiple services or databases. I've observed firsthand how effective caching strategies have reduced latency by up to 70% in certain API endpoints. In a modular monolith, you can even have domain-specific cache strategies that can be fine-tuned to meet the needs of each module. FastAPI provides ample support for incorporating various caching mechanisms. Here are some ways you can do it: + Dependency Injection ‚Ü≥ Easily inject cache instances into your FastAPI routes, making it more maintainable and testable. + Middleware Support ‚Ü≥ Use middlewares to implement caching policies across multiple routes or even the entire application. FastAPI's middleware support makes this straightforward. + Asynchronous Caching ‚Ü≥ With native support for asynchronous programming, FastAPI allows for non-blocking cache operations, enhancing performance further. ‚Üí What's your go-to caching strategy? P.S. Repost this ‚ôªÔ∏è for the sake of others
