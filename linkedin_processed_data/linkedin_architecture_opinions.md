Hey everyone, it's good to be back on LinkedIn! Stepping away allowed me to recognize the value this platform brings. Connections formed, conversations sparked, ideas shared—a dynamic ecosystem. Meanwhile, I've been keeping myself busy - diving into my first real book-writing journey, a Django cookbook, has been an eye-opener. After hours of research and miles of writing later, I'm genuinely in awe of those who've trodden this path and penned down technology wisdom for the rest of us. As I dive back into the LinkedIn scene, I'm excited about reconnecting with the local SaaS community. I can't wait for the Tekpon Awards event. Meeting Cristian Dina and Alexandru Stan was a fantastic kickoff. After reading King of Networking, it felt like meeting old friends rather than new connections. I'm excited to catch up with all of you, learn from you, and share my wisdom. Hit me up if you're around! Here's to more connections, more learning, and more fun. Let's get back to business!

In tech, we often ask, "WHO broke the build?" instead of "WHAT in our process allowed this to happen?" The most innovative teams don't point fingers - they point to processes. Take Etsy's example: They can deploy code 50 times a day because they've built a culture where every incident is a learning opportunity, not a witch hunt. Their blameless post-mortems focus on system improvements rather than individual mistakes. The results? - Higher team morale (people aren't afraid to take risks) - Better retention (psychological safety = loyal teams) - Faster innovation (when fear goes down, creativity goes up) The next time something breaks, try asking: - WHAT guardrails could prevent this? - HOW can we make the right way the easy way? - WHAT system improvements would make this impossible to repeat? Processes can be fixed. People need to be empowered. As an engineer, I experienced one of the most significant leaps in growth after owning a mistake and focusing on improving the process to prevent similar mistakes in the future. What do you think about building a blame-free culture? 👇

Scaling your tech product isn't just about adding users or selling more units. It's about creating a product that customers love and can't do without. It's a strategic journey that ensures sustainable growth. 🚀 Consider your infrastructure. It's the backbone of your scaling efforts. It's what allows you to handle increased demand without compromising on performance. From cloud services to serverless architecture, choosing the right infrastructure is key to your growth story. But infrastructure alone isn't enough. You also need to focus on feature enhancements. Striking a balance between improving core features and introducing new ones is crucial for user retention and product growth. Remember, as Marty Cagan emphasizes in "Inspired," the best tech products are those that solve real problems for users in ways that are valuable, usable and feasible. And as you scale, never lose sight of your users. Maintaining high-quality user support is paramount. Scaling your support systems to meet the growing needs of your users ensures they always have a positive experience with your product. 🤝 Scaling a tech product is a complex, strategic process.

I've often found myself in the trenches of 'technical debt', a common byproduct of the MVP-building process. However, recently I've come to appreciate a fresh perspective - viewing technical debt as an opportunity to build 'technical wealth'. Technical wealth is about transforming our liabilities into assets, about gaining productivity that compounds over time. It's about remodeling our software, not just rewriting it. It's about breaking monolithic apps into micro-services, decoupling features, and establishing automated testing. It's about fostering a culture that prioritizes resolving technical debt and making our engineers more productive. Here are some strategies that have helped us manage technical debt and build technical wealth: 1. Identify and Assess: Recognize areas where technical debt has accumulated and prioritize them based on their impact on your product. 2. Plan and Implement: Develop a comprehensive plan to tackle the technical debt, including timelines, resources, and budgets. 3. Software Remodeling: Instead of rewriting your code from scratch, consider remodeling it. This could involve breaking monolithic apps into micro-services, decoupling features, refreshing branding, establishing automated testing, and refactoring codebases. 4. Automated Testing and Continuous Delivery: Implement automated testing to validate your system and continuous delivery to automate delivery-related tasks. This will help you deploy changes quickly and efficiently. 5. Cultural Upgrades: Foster a culture that prioritizes resolving technical debt. This could involve resisting the urge to reward late-night work, encouraging collaboration techniques, and putting empathy at the center of everything you do. 6. Hire Menders: Contrary to popular belief, there are engineers who enjoy working on legacy code. These 'menders' are detail-oriented and love solving challenging problems. Find them, hire them, and give them the autonomy and tools they need to thrive. 7. Embrace Stability: As your startup grows, there will come a time when stability becomes as important as growth. This doesn't mean growth ends, but rather that you have the people and processes in place to build technical wealth and spend it on the right priorities. By adopting these strategies, we can turn technical debt into technical wealth, ensuring our product remains on track for success. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts! At what point in your startup's growth did you start to focus on stability? How did this shift impact your approach to managing technical debt? #technicaldebt #techleadership #startups #scaleups #techfounders

Delaying the transition to microservices could be a smart move. Even if you need to scale to microservices. Starting with a modular monolith is a wise strategic move. 🎯Master complexity: ↳ Starting with a modular monolith allows teams to manage complexity in a more controlled environment, avoiding the distributed chaos typical with premature microservices implementations. 📈 Scale on demand: ↳ Modular monoliths provide the flexibility to scale components as needed without the upfront investment in separate services. This means you can expand your system organically based on growth and user demand. 🛠 Easier refactoring and testing: ↳ With more transparent and consolidated codebases, modular monoliths facilitate easier refactoring and testing, which are crucial in the early stages when changes are frequent and critical. The rush towards microservices can often lead to unnecessary complications. Could you pause and consider it? Do the benefits outweigh the initial complexity? Are you adopting microservices as a strategic necessity or simply following a trend? It's time to reconsider your path towards scaling. Choosing a modular monolith can steer your team's focus towards what truly matters - innovation and stability, creating a robust foundation for future growth. -> Ready to debate these alternatives and their long-term impacts?

Product management isn't just about gut feelings. Numbers matter too. Here are 6 reasons why: 1. Clear goals with numbers: Define success with specific numbers. It gives a clear aim and helps measure results objectively. 2. Minimum viable market share: Figure out the smallest market share your product needs to survive. It's about balancing actual results and your goals. 3. Using a points system: Use a points system to guess your chances of success. Create market tests, collect data, and change your plan based on the results. 4. Market interest as a success predictor: Check if people are interested before you fully develop your product. This can lower the risk of making something people don't want. 5. Constant data checks: Keep checking and changing your plans based on new market data. This keeps your product plan in line with what customers say. 6. Avoiding data biases: Be careful not to twist data to fit your views. Make sure your choices are based on complete and fair data analysis. For those starting a tech business, these ideas can guide you to make better, data-supported choices in product development. → How have you integrated data-driven strategies in your product management?

Is your technology holding back your scale-up's growth? Discover the strategic factors that ensure your tech stack scales with your business goals: Choosing the right technology stack for your scale-up is more than a technical decision. It's a strategic one that can either propel your business forward or hold it back. Here's how to approach it: + Reliability and scalability ↳ Imagine losing customer data during a peak sales event. Ensure your tech stack can handle growing customer demands without faltering. + Simplicity and efficiency ↳ Speed-to-market can be your competitive edge. Opt for technologies that help you move fast without compromising quality. + Security and performance testing ↳ A single breach can cost you more than just money; it can damage your reputation. Make sure your tech stack passes stringent security checks. + Future-proofing your business ↳ Your tech stack should accommodate growth and adapt to market changes without requiring a system overhaul. + Ownership and strategic control ↳ Being at the mercy of third-party providers can limit your strategic moves. Aim for a tech stack that you can control and adapt to your specific business needs. The right choices today can set you up for scalable, secure, and efficient operations that align with your long-term business goals. Don't let your tech stack be your bottleneck. Let it be your enabler. → What's your experience with scaling technology in line with business growth? Any lessons learned or pitfalls to avoid?

For service providers or B2B SaaS founders, filtering LinkedIn leads requires a different lens, focusing on business growth, client relationships, and strategic partnerships. Let's adapt the approach to be more relevant to your context: - Targeted profile optimization: Tailor your LinkedIn profile to appeal directly to your ideal client segment. Use industry-specific jargon and showcase your expertise in solving problems unique to your target audience. Highlight successful case studies or testimonials from past clients. - Keyword strategy for B2B market: Incorporate keywords that resonate with your target market. This could include industry-specific terms, pain points your service addresses, and the unique value proposition of your SaaS solution. - Qualifying qeads by business needs: When you receive a lead, assess if their business challenges align with your solution. Are they at the right stage of growth? Do they belong to industries you specialize in? - Company size and maturity assessment: Prioritize leads from companies that are at the right growth stage for your services. Startups might need more hands-on support and flexibility, whereas larger enterprises may value scalability and robustness. - Budget alignment: Ensure that the budgetary expectations of potential clients align with your pricing models. Avoid leads that undervalue your service or are not in a position to afford your solution. - Deeper engagement with potential clients: Once a lead seems promising, engage in deeper conversations. Understand their specific pain points, decision-making process, and how your solution can uniquely address their needs. - Clarifying engagement expectations: Discuss the scope of work, expected outcomes, and timelines. This ensures both parties have a clear understanding of the engagement. - Demonstrating credibility and expertise: Share resources like whitepapers, case studies, or demos of your SaaS solution. This helps in establishing credibility and demonstrating the effectiveness of your service. - Leveraging and expanding your network: Utilize your existing network for referrals and introductions. Join industry-specific groups to stay updated on trends and engage with potential clients. - Continuous learning and adaptation: Stay abreast of industry trends and continuously evolve your offering to meet the changing needs of your target market. For service providers and B2B SaaS founders, LinkedIn can be a goldmine of opportunities if approached strategically.

Think you've cracked the code to digital success? You might want to take another look. Innovation and advanced technology are important, but they are not the only factors that drive success. A more nuanced approach is needed to truly excel. Aim to strike the balance between innovation and nuance. Based on my personal experience, I believe that four key elements contribute to success: 1. Mastering Your Market - Ever seen a worthy startup fade into oblivion? Their superior product couldn't save them from a market mismatch. Know your audience intimately. 2. Scaling Smartly – When your servers buckle under peak traffic, it's time to review your infrastructure. Scalability isn’t a luxury; it’s a necessity. 3. Embracing Change – In tech, change is the only constant. Staying agile and adapting to shifting trends is paramount. 4. Assembling A-teams - A blend of wisdom, creativity, and ambition forms an unbeatable team. They don't just work side by side—they grow side by side. Many startups hesitate to leap, haunted by 'what ifs'. But remember, doing nothing costs you too. Each day not spent evolving is a day ceded to a competitor on the move. It's high time we stop fearing the 'what ifs' and start asking 'why not'. - Why not dive headfirst and launch that revolutionary product? - Why not back a team itching to shake things up? - Why not prioritize adaptability to stay ahead of the curve? - Why not ensure your solution is built to scale? Break free from the ordinary. Innovate. Every day presents a fresh chance to pen your own digital success story. -> Got thoughts, insights, or experiences to share on this subject? ♻️ Feel this post could inspire someone? Spread the word.

Building a SaaS on the side is a smart move. Businesses are looking for niche solutions. Identify a problem you’ve faced or observed and build a SaaS that solves it. On the other hand, SaaS gives you control and freedom to experiment, unlike working on someone else’s vision. The tech ecosystem is evolving, and niche SaaS solutions are thriving. Companies value tailored, affordable tools over monolithic platforms. Start small. Launch quickly. Iterate often. Your side project could become your next big thing. -> What’s stopping you from starting? Here’s what David Weiss just launched today.

Ever wonder why pouring profits back into tech doesn't always yield the expected ROI? 1. Unnecessary rewrites Tempted to overhaul your existing code? Think twice. Rewrites are expensive and often don't deliver the expected value. Focus instead on strategic refactoring. 2. Premature scaling Scaling before validating your market fit or understanding your capacity can be a recipe for failure. Make data-driven decisions to know when you're actually ready to scale. 3. Ignoring technical debt It's easy to overlook technical debt in the rush to push new features. Yet, this can result in a fragile system that's costly to maintain. Address technical debt as part of your ongoing strategy. 4. Misaligned tech stack Your technology should align with your business goals. An inappropriate tech stack can lead to inefficiency and waste. Regularly review your stack's alignment with your objectives. 5. Lack of focus on IP Intellectual Property (IP) is a significant asset. If you're outsourcing, ensure you retain the rights to your code. Building your own IP enhances your company's valuation. 6. Not measuring ROI Reinvestment should be about long-term returns, not just immediate gains. Employ metrics to measure the ROI on tech initiatives to ensure they contribute to business growth. If you've faced any of these reinvestment traps, I'd love to hear how you navigated them. What worked for you? What didn't? Share your experiences and let's learn from each other.

In 2011, as a budding developer, I embarked on a project that now feels like a relic from a bygone era. We were crafting an interactive website that allowed users to draw their house outlines and place sensor dots on a digital map. It was innovative for its time and a project that truly ignited my passion for development. Back then, jQuery was our lifeline. It simplified the JavaScript chaos, making DOM manipulation a breeze. For our project, it was essential in creating a smooth, user-interactive experience. Internet connectivity wasn't a given. We had to support feature phones and Blackberry devices, alongside the emerging Android and iOS platforms. It involved intricate work with Java Midlet, learning the quirks of each platform, and even using ant background jobs for building and signing applications. Our approach to overcoming limited internet access was creative. We generated images for each floor of a house in the background, bundled them into the build, and then transferred them via cable during installation. This ensured users had offline access to critical data. When an alert was triggered, a custom binary SMS was sent to the device. This was our primitive yet effective push notification system, long before the advent of modern cloud-based push services. Reflecting on this journey is not just about nostalgia. It highlights the incredible pace of technological evolution and the importance of adaptability. This journey shaped my understanding of technology's impact and the importance of staying agile in a rapidly changing digital landscape. How has your journey with technology evolved?

Today, I want to highlight the risks of ignoring key scaling strategies in your SaaS journey, especially when growing from a small team of under 8 to a robust group of around 40. Think of 2 online service startups, both full of promise. One, we'll call it 'NextGenTech', understands the importance of strategic growth. The other, 'QuickScale', rushes forward without a solid plan. NextGenTech focuses on: 1. Deep customer understanding: They constantly engage with their users, refining their product to meet real needs. 2. Robust tech infrastructure: Utilizing Python and cloud solutions, they build a system that's not just for today, but scalable for tomorrow. 3. Adopting agile practices: Flexibility is their mantra. They adapt, learn, and grow with each market shift. 4. Cultivating a strong team culture: From 8 to 40, each member is aligned with the company's vision and values. 5. Financial acumen: They scale with a keen eye on costs and returns, ensuring sustainable growth. QuickScale grows quickly, but problems soon show up. They deal with issues like product problems, unhappy customers, team breakups, and money troubles. Because they tried to grow too fast, they forgot about what's really important. Here lies the FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) in startup scaling: - Without deep market understanding, you're shooting arrows in the dark, missing opportunities to truly resonate with your audience. - Ignore your tech infrastructure, and watch as your systems crumble under pressure, leaving you lagging while competitors surge ahead. - Sideline your team culture, and you'll find yourself with a group of disengaged employees, leading to a revolving door of talent. - Mismanage your finances, and you may find yourself in a pit of debt, with a shrinking runway and no lifeline. → Determining the right strategy is just the first step. How can you ensure that the correct tactics are deployed to implement this strategy? P.S. In "The Startup Scaling Blueprint," I've laid out the strategies and tactics crucial for avoiding these pitfalls. From personal anecdotes to lessons from industry giants, this guide is your compass in the scaling wilderness.

Christmas came early this year for me. Upskilling is the best way to stay ahead of the curve in the ever-evolving world of software development, especially when it comes to microservices architecture. In his book, Bootstrapping Microservices, Ashley Davis explains the importance of upskilling for developers, and why it is key to successful microservices projects. Upskilling involves taking the time to learn about new technologies, tools, and techniques. This can include taking courses, attending conferences, and reading books. By upskilling, developers can become more knowledgeable and able to use the latest technologies in their projects. This is especially important in microservices architecture, as Davis explains: “Software development and deployment cycles are becoming increasingly rapid and iterative, and developers must be constantly learning in order to keep pace.” Upskilling is also important because developers can use their new knowledge to come up with new solutions to problems. This can be especially beneficial in microservices architecture, where developers must be able to quickly adapt to changing demands. Gaining new skills and knowledge is the key to staying ahead of the game in the ever-evolving world of software development. If you’re looking to stay on top of the game, upskilling is the way to go! #learning #architecture #microservices #softwaredevelopment #upskilling #docker #kubernetes #azure

Struggling to find the sweet spot between technical specialization and business strategy? Are you torn between going deep into tech or focusing on business outcomes? Here’s how to integrate specialized tech skills into a broader business strategy for lasting success: + Tech-business alignment ↳ Technical leaders must ensure that specialized skills align with business goals. Being a subject matter expert is great, but it's futile if it doesn't drive business outcomes. + ROI of specialization ↳ Specializing in a tech field is an investment. Make sure it pays dividends by aligning it with market demands and business objectives. + Problem-solving for business ↳ Specialization can lead to tunnel vision. Balance it by understanding broader business challenges that your tech expertise can solve. + Adaptability in strategy ↳ Markets change; your specialization might not always be in demand. Always have a backup skill set that complements your main focus. + Informed decision-making ↳ Use your specialized knowledge to influence business decisions. Technical leaders should be a bridge between the tech team and the C-suite. + Skill portfolio ↳ Don't put all your eggs in one basket. Build a portfolio of complementary skills that provide value in various business contexts. + Leadership in specialization ↳ Being a leader in a specialized field requires more than expertise; it demands an understanding of how that specialization fits into the business ecosystem. → How are you balancing your technical specialization with business strategy? Have you faced challenges in aligning the two? P.S. If aligning your specialized skills with business outcomes is a challenge, feel free to reach out.

Today, let's debunk a myth: When you're facing pressure to scale your product and development team, it's important to recognise that microservices might not be the best solution for you. Trust me, I've learned this the hard way. Why you might want to pump the brakes on microservices: + Startup struggles ↳ if you're a startup, the overhead of managing multiple services can be a nightmare + Complexity overhead ↳ your team will have to handle intricate orchestration, network latency, and data consistency + The trade-offs ↳ you might gain in scalability but lose in tech flexibility Microservices might offer scalability but remember, they come with their own set of complexities. On the flip side, modular monoliths offer a simpler approach, especially beneficial for startups and smaller teams. Why you should consider using modular monoliths: + Decoupling done right ↳ you can decouple modules using message queues, creating a well-defined boundary without the complexity of microservices + Flexibility ↳ provides the ease to transition into microservices when you're ready to scale +Clean and maintainable ↳ by using Clean Architecture and DDD, modular monoliths can be a joy to work with In one of my recent endeavors, opting for a modular monolith over microservices helped us cut down development time by 30-40%. Plus, the application's performance was beyond what we initially aimed for. Whether it's microservices or modular monoliths, your choice will have long-term consequences on project scalability, maintainability, and performance. So choose wisely. Your turn: Are you team microservices or do you lean towards modular monoliths? P.S. Have you ever chosen the wrong architecture and lived to tell the tale? P.S.S.
