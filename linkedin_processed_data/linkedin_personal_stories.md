For a long time, I've thought about starting my own newsletter. But it seemed like a big challenge. The thing stopping me? I believed I needed to build my confidence first before taking the leap. The reality, I discovered, is quite the opposite. You don't build confidence and then leap; you leap and that's how you build your confidence. It's in stepping out of your comfort zone, in practicing and putting yourself out there, that you truly become ready. Why choose newsletters as a medium for this leap? Here are 5 reasons why newsletters are the best way to stay informed and connected: 1. Curated content: Newsletters offer a curated selection of content tailored to your interests, cutting through the noise of endless online information. 2. Direct connection: They create a direct line between the writer and the reader, fostering a personal connection that's rare in today's digital world. 3. Consistency: Regular updates mean you‚Äôre always in the loop on the latest trends, insights, or news without having to search for it. 4. Depth and insight: Unlike fleeting social media updates, newsletters can dive deeper into topics, providing valuable insights and perspectives. 5. Community: Subscribing to newsletters can feel like joining a community of like-minded individuals, where shared knowledge enriches us all. As I finally launch my newsletter, I realize the importance of practicing outside your comfort zone. It's not just about sharing what I know; it's about growing, learning, and connecting with others on the same journey. If you've been hesitating to take your own leap, remember: your confidence grows with each step you dare to take. Let's embrace the leap together and see where this journey takes us. ‚ôªÔ∏è P.S.

In my journey of over 14 years in the tech industry and through my own venture, CodeSwiftr, I've come to appreciate the unsung hero of software development - the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). It's not just a framework, it's a compass that guides us from a nebulous idea to a tangible product. Why am I such a fan of SDLC? It's the clarity it brings to the chaos. It structures our efforts, improves communication, boosts efficiency, and reduces risks. Most importantly, it ensures that the final product is a true reflection of the user's needs. Here's a quick tour of the SDLC journey: 1. Requirement Analysis: This is where empathy comes into play. We step into the shoes of the end-users, understanding their needs, and defining the problem we're solving. 2. Design: We sketch the blueprint of the software architecture, providing a roadmap for the developers. 3. Implementation: This is where the blueprint comes to life - developers start coding. 4. Testing: We rigorously check the software for bugs and ensure it aligns with the initial requirements. 5. Deployment: The software is finally ready to meet its users. 6. Maintenance: The journey doesn't end at deployment. We continuously refine and improve the software based on user feedback and evolving needs. SDLC is not just a process, it's a philosophy that helps us navigate the complex labyrinth of software development, leading to a successful, user-centric product. I'm curious to hear about your adventures with SDLC. What challenges have you faced? How did you tackle them? #softwaredevelopment #softwaredesign #CodeSwiftr #techleadership #scaleup

Reflecting on my journey as an entrepreneur, I've come to realize that it doesn't come with a manual. Today, I'm shedding light on the less glamorous, yet equally essential aspects of my entrepreneurial journey: Not every idea I've had was validated or successful. I've sat through meetings that could have been emails. While I thrive in my niche, I don't claim to be an all-knowing oracle. I've often agreed when I should've respectfully declined. Networking isn't my full-time job, nor is it a constant pursuit. I've not always leveraged my network for personal gain. Work-life boundaries? I'm still figuring it out. Selling doesn't always come naturally to me. I've fumbled with criticism. My communication with clients isn't always as frequent as the "rule book" dictates. I've prioritized product features poorly on occasions. Adapting swiftly is a skill I'm still honing. Keeping up with every industry trend is not always feasible. I don't always implement everything I learn. Over-communicating with stakeholders is a work-in-progress. Facing challenges with grace? Not always. Consistently implementing habits is a struggle. Stepping out of my comfort zone still brings jitters. Engaging in continuous improvement? It's a journey, not a destination. And yes, I've failed more times than I can remember. If one were to measure by the entrepreneurial "rule books," I'd have strayed from the course countless times. Yet, here I am, leading CodeSwiftr, evolving every day, extracting joy from this extraordinary journey. Social media often glorifies entrepreneurship, but it seldom exposes its gritty reality. We have our challenges, pace, and unique paths. The magic lies in embracing our individual processes, learning from our trials, and relentlessly pushing towards growth. Remember, there's no "perfect" entrepreneur. Perfection isn't the aim. It's about commitment, resilience, and constant learning. üöÄ How have you embraced your unique path and navigated the hurdles?

To succeed, it's important to be careful about what you practice. Whether you want to improve as a writer, developer, or communicator, you have to spend your time and effort on the right things. For me, this means always learning and getting better. I keep up with new ideas and technology by reading articles, going to conferences, and joining online groups. Right now, I'm working on getting better at software architecture, product management and writing. I've been writing short-form posts on LinkedIn for over a year. Now, I've decided to also learn how to visualize ideas using simple doodle illustrations, and how to write longer content. As a result, I've started a newsletter. Practicing these has made me more confident and skilled at my job. But it's not just about learning the tools. To really get better, you have to use what you learn. This has given me practical experience and improved my skills. But not all skills are the same. Depending on your career goals, you might need to focus on certain areas. For example, if you want to be a team leader or manager, you might need to work on your communication and leadership skills. If you want to be an expert in a specific technology or area, you might need to deepen your knowledge there. The main thing is to be thoughtful and planned about how you get better. Pick the skills you want to work on and make a plan to spend your time and energy on those. Reading about it is a good start, but actually doing it is what really makes you learn. Focusing on what we're good at can keep us motivated and help us keep our willpower. By doing what we enjoy and are good at, we can find a natural source of energy and excitement that helps us face challenges. It's important to balance working on weaknesses and strengths to avoid losing willpower. What skills are you trying to improve? ‚ôªÔ∏è P.S. Support my journey by subscribing to my Substack!

Ever agreed with information because it just made sense? We prefer facts that confirm our views and ignore contradicting ones. Here's why this is important: - It narrows our perspective, blocking out potentially valuable insights. - It can lead us to self-reinforcing assumptions, away from innovative solutions. - It means overlooking critical data that challenge our preconceived notions. How to Combat It? - Seek out contrary evidence. Look for information that challenges your beliefs. - Encourage diverse perspectives. Engage with thoughts and different opinions. - A culture of questioning. Question assumptions and explore alternatives. To avoid confirmation bias, consider exploring a wider range of information. Make decisions grounded in a more comprehensive view of reality. ‚Üí What strategies do you use to ensure diverse viewpoints are considered in your decision-making process? ‚ôªÔ∏è P.S.

In my journey through the tech world, particularly in game development, I've always been intrigued by how habits shape user interactions with technology. Habit formation has a profound impact on the product success. Here's a distilled insight, leveraging Charles Duhigg's "The Power of Habit," tailored for SaaS founders + Habit loops in product design: ‚Ü≥ Embed cue-routine-reward cycles in your product. Make each interaction a step towards habitual use. For instance, notifications (cue) leading to easy task completion (routine) and instant gratification (reward). + Small wins ‚Ü≥ Focus on incremental achievements. Each small win hooks users, driving deeper engagement. Imagine a feature that saves five minutes daily ‚Äì small, yet significant. + Keystone habits: ‚Ü≥ Focus on keystone habits, which can lead to other positive habits when changed. By incorporating these into your product design, you can significantly impact user behavior and engagement. + Leveraging social habits: ‚Ü≥ Incorporate social elements into your SaaS product to leverage the power of social habits. This could be through features that encourage collaboration, sharing, or community building. Social habits can greatly enhance user engagement and loyalty. Change and habit formation: ‚Ü≥ Understanding the habit loop in product design helps in shaping user habits. By providing cues and rewards, you can encourage users to adopt new behaviors or drop undesirable ones. + Data-driven habit analysis: ‚Ü≥ Utilize data to understand and shape user habits. This can guide feature development, user interface improvements, and personalized user experiences, ultimately driving product success. Routine centric design: ‚Ü≥ Design your product to enhance user's daily routines. This makes the product a part of their habits and also ensures its relevance and usefulness. "The Power of Habit" is one of my favorite books on habits. It provides a lens through which to view and shape user interaction with technology. For those in the tech and SaaS industries, it's a valuable resource for understanding and influencing user behavior. Reflecting on Duhigg's framework ‚Äì identifying routines, experimenting with rewards, isolating cues, and having a plan ‚Äì I see a direct application in tech product development. These principles are actionable strategies that can deeply engage and retain users. ‚Üí What are your thoughts on integrating these principles into product development? P.S. Hey, why not share this around? ‚ôªÔ∏è You never know who might find it helpful!

Let me share a personal moment from my journey that taught me an important lesson about not missing out on opportunities. It's a story about taking chances and how they can affect our careers. A few years back, I got a message on LinkedIn. Someone needed a Unity expert for a one-day project. At that time, I had been working with Unity for a while, and I felt confident in my skills. But here's the twist - I wasn't actively looking for new projects. The opportunity was right there in my inbox, waiting for me to take it. I could have easily ignored it, citing my ongoing workload or the comfort of sticking to my routine. However, something inside me urged me to go for it. I made the decision to seize the opportunity. I put all my expertise into that Unity project. The result? A happy client who came back for more, even though we couldn't achieve the project's full scope initially because of a limitation in a third-party library. Now, let's fast forward a bit. That seemingly small decision to act on that opportunity had a ripple effect. It led to more projects, expanded my professional network, and opened up new opportunities. It reminded me that not taking action can sometimes cost us more than we realize. In the worlds of tech and leadership, this lesson is universal. When we hesitate, resist change, or overlook opportunities to innovate, the consequences of inaction can be significant. The message here is clear: Embrace opportunities, be open to change, and seize those moments. Whether it's a short project or a major shift in leadership, taking action can lead to growth, success, and unexpected journeys. So, my advice to you is simple - keep an eye out for those moments of opportunity. Don't let the fear of missing out hold you back. Take action, adapt to change, and turn those moments into your success stories.

Have you ever thought about how a single remote project could change your life in a big way? I decided to leave behind a successful career and take on a remote Unity project that ended up reshaping my life's direction. In the story of my career, filled with coding adventures, I found myself at a critical point. I had recently left a job at Ubisoft, where I had worked for four years on mobile game development. Before that, I was a Java Engineer working with clients in the Benelux region. But change was in the air. I received a message on my LinkedIn, offering me a one-day Unity project. It was a chance to try something new and unfamiliar. I was already experienced with Unity, so I wasn't too worried about the tech challenges. Things didn't go as planned.During one of our initial calls, I got caught up in an unconventional "trash the dress" photoshoot while I was out of town. In all the chaos, I barely understood what the client wanted. But as someone who enjoys challenges and doesn't shy away from them, I decided to take on the project anyway. The catch? I had to work with another developer from Silicon Valley, and to match our time zones, I had to wake up at 5 AM. Our goal was to create a Unity plugin for Face Recognition‚Äîa project that felt more like a university research project than a typical job. For two weeks straight, I worked on this project every morning before sunrise. I was guided by an experienced software engineer with over 20 years of experience, mostly in research and development. It felt like an intense crash course in the fast-paced tech world of the United States. This experience showed me the potential of early mornings, and I realized how much I could achieve during those quiet hours. After our intense collaboration, we realized that the project we were working on wasn't worth pursuing. So, we took a break. But something had changed in me during those early morning sessions of hard work and learning. I made a conscious decision to continue waking up at 5 AM, but this time, it wasn't for a project; it was for my personal growth. I understood the value of dedicating quality time to myself. I had always been passionate about software development, but I often struggled to stay consistent with side projects and learning new skills beyond my daily work. With this newfound dedication, I started a transformative journey. I watched video tutorials during my early morning hours, coding along with them and building my own mobile game projects. It didn't take long before I was ready to publish one of my side projects, thanks to the knowledge I had gained. This remote experience taught me the power of dedication, the value of early mornings, and the endless potential within us when we commit to our own growth. It was a pivotal chapter in my journey, one that forever changed my approach to learning and achieving my goals. ‚Üí Have you ever experienced a moment that shifted your perspective and led to personal transformation?

In the world of startups, where coffee is key and sleep is scarce, founders often face tough problems. Dreams and new ideas might be stopped by doubts, which can slow down progress and success. Here are 7 common limiting beliefs that tech startup founders may struggle with: 1. Fear of failure: This fear can stop us from taking important risks. 2. Impostor syndrome: Feeling like a wolf in sheep's clothing. 3. Lone wolf fallacy: The belief that you need to be a one-person army. 4. Product tunnel vision: Thinking your product will conquer the world. 5. Control freakery: Fear that giving up control could unsettle your startup. 6. Perfection paralysis: Striving for perfection can cause procrastination. 7. Networking naysaying: Assuming networking isn't for visionary founders. Tech startup founders need to find and tackle any limiting beliefs. This helps them overcome problems and have a mindset that aims for growth. To do this, they should not be afraid of taking risks, should ask for help when needed, should know their priorities, and should value their relationships. Avoid letting your beliefs become part of your self-concept. You are not defined by your thoughts, but rather by your values. Beliefs represent what you consider to be true, while values represent what you deem important. You should maintain a set of guiding principles, but remain flexible when it comes to practices and policies. ‚Üí What other limiting beliefs have you noticed or struggled with? ‚ôªÔ∏è P.S.

Unlock 10% more productivity as a senior software engineer with the power of CLI tools. After dedicating three years to mastering these text-only tools, I experienced a significant improvement in my efficiency and confidence. Here's a list of 15 essential CLI tools you need to know. Start your deliberate practice regime today and watch your productivity soar! Three years ago, I set a goal to become more comfortable with text-only CLI tools and began a deliberate practice regime. This involved building a workflow with Vim, Tux, and oh-my-zsh. The results have been remarkable - I've noticed a significant improvement in my productivity and efficiency, and I feel confident tackling even the most complex and challenging projects. Here are some key CLI tools that I've found particularly useful: cat is used to read, print, and combine files. echo displays a line of text on standard output or in a file. sed is a popular stream editor used for filtering and substituting in files and text data streams. sort sorts text files and output streams in ascending or descending order. uniq eliminates duplicate entries in a text file. paste combines fields from different files, or extracts and combines lines from multiple sources. join combines lines from two files based on a common field. split breaks up a large file into equal-sized segments. grep searches text files and data streams for patterns and can be used with regular expressions. tee saves a copy of standard output to a file while still displaying at the terminal. wc (word count) displays the number of lines, words, and characters in a file or group of files. cut extracts columns from a file. less views files a page at a time and allows scrolling in both directions. head displays the first few lines of a file or data stream on standard output (10 by default). tail displays the last few lines of a file or data stream on standard output (10 by default). Becoming proficient with CLI tools is an invaluable skill for any senior software engineer, and I encourage you to start your own deliberate practice regime to improve your own proficiency. Share your experience and insights on the tools that have made the biggest impact on your productivity and efficiency.

Do you find yourself constantly pulled into meetings? Software engineers aren't big fans of meetings like managers are! Some managers fill their schedules with 30-minute meetings and calls throughout the day, but, from my experience, I believe that 95% of these meetings are unnecessary. Personally, I find value in two types of meetings: üîπ A quick daily standup, limited to 15 minutes. üîπ A weekly one-on-one with my direct reports, where they can discuss what they want, rather than just providing status updates. What about the rest? I avoid meetings that lack a clear agenda. If my presence isn't adding value, I have no problem skipping them. Many people think that being busy means being important. But having a lot of meetings doesn't automatically make someone important. Here's how you can make meetings more effective: 1. Avoid Unnecessary Meetings: Use email or project management tools for status updates. Share information in writing or through pre-recorded videos (like Loom). 2. Plan Ahead: Send out the meeting agenda in advance, along with any reading materials and a schedule. 3. Be Time Conscious: Meetings don't have to default to one hour. Try shorter timeframes instead. 4. Start on Time: Begin the meeting promptly and avoid recapping for latecomers. 5. Stick to the Schedule: Encourage silent participants to reclaim their time and leave if they don't need to be there. 6. Evaluate: After the meeting, assess how similar meetings can be eliminated in the future. Meetings are supposed to be helpful, not frustrating. Being busy is different from being productive. What other strategies do you apply to optimize the time spent in meetings? P.S. Repost if this is useful ‚ôªÔ∏è #softwareengineering #meetings #techleadership #engineeringmanagement #codeswiftr

Hey #network, I understand the importance of having the right tools and processes in place for successful deployment and management of microservices. That's why I highly recommend the book "Bootstrapping Microservices" by Ashley Davis. One key aspect that the book focuses on is best practices for working with Terraform and Kubernetes. Here are seven actionable items that I've found helpful in my experience: 1. Use infrastructure as code: Terraform provides a declarative way to manage infrastructure, including Kubernetes resources. By defining your infrastructure in code, you can manage your Kubernetes resources in a similar way to other infrastructure resources. This approach helps you keep your infrastructure organized and easily reusable across multiple services. 2. Keep your code modular: Use Terraform modules to break down your infrastructure into smaller, reusable components. This will help you maintain your code in a way that is easier to understand, manage, and reuse. 3. Store your Terraform code in version control: Version control systems, like Git, can help you manage and collaborate on your code effectively. By using version control, you can track changes over time and collaborate with your team easily. 4. Use variables to keep your code flexible: Terraform variables allow you to keep your code flexible and reusable. By defining variables in your Terraform code, you can easily configure your Kubernetes resources for different environments. 5. Use the Kubernetes provider: The Kubernetes provider is a powerful tool that allows you to manage your Kubernetes resources with Terraform. It supports a wide range of Kubernetes resources, including deployments, services, and secrets. 6. Use Terraform state to manage the state of your infrastructure: By using Terraform state, you can track changes to your infrastructure over time and ensure that your desired state is maintained. 7. Test your code before applying changes to your infrastructure: Use Terraform validate and plan commands to test your code before applying changes to your infrastructure. This helps ensure that your code is correct and that changes will be applied correctly. By following these best practices, you can effectively manage your Kubernetes resources with Terraform and maintain a stable and reliable infrastructure. Whether you're just starting out or looking to improve your existing infrastructure, these tips can help you achieve your goals. As always, I'm passionate about helping others improve their workflows and processes, so feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or would like to discuss these best practices further. Let's continue to learn and grow together as a community! #terraform #kubernetes #microservices #devops

Many software engineers perceive mastering Command Line Interface (CLI) tools as: ‚Üí Reading documentation ‚Üí Practicing commands occasionally ‚Üí Using them only when necessary While these aspects are part of the learning curve, they don't capture the full power of CLI mastery. Here's a straightforward perspective of what CLI mastery could mean for a developer: CLI Mastery = How you: 1. Understand its tools 2. Implement them regularly 3. Innovate with them Three years ago, I made a deliberate effort to become proficient in CLI tools, and the boost in productivity has been remarkable. The essential CLI tools, such as cat, echo, sed, and grep, among others, each with its unique purpose, have empowered me to tackle even the most challenging projects with confidence. However, mastering CLI is not a solo journey. Insights and experiences from the community have been invaluable. Tools like 'curl' for HTTP requests, 'jq' to format JSON responses, and learning regular expressions were mentioned as additional game-changers by fellow engineers. This brings me to a realization - our shared wisdom can significantly contribute to each other's growth and productivity. So, let me ask you - what CLI tools or practices have made a significant impact on your efficiency as a developer? Are you covering the 3 steps to CLI mastery? If not, it might be time to rethink your strategy and start a deliberate practice regime today. #cli #productivityboost #softwaredevelopment #productivity #linux #unix #terminal

Writing a Django book while working on a FastAPI project has taught me: why it's important to choose the right tools. Often, the simplest approach is most effective. üîë Django + HTMX = Love ‚ù§Ô∏è While complex front-end frameworks like React are popular, simpler solutions are more than enough to validate your product assumptions. For many projects, Django‚Äîeither on its own or paired with HTMX‚Äîcan be highly effective, eliminating the need for additional front-end frameworks. HTMX enables modern, interactive features without complex front-end setups, allowing server-side management for simpler, more maintainable projects. I‚Äôm a big believer in delaying complexity. Not every project requires the overhead of a full client-server split, especially early on. Django‚Äôs out-of-the-box tools, when combined with HTMX, allow you to build interactive, responsive UIs without the steep learning curve or setup of modern front-end frameworks. For some projects, this approach saves time, reduces bugs, and makes future scaling easier because you're not prematurely optimizing for scenarios that may never come. My experience with FastAPI and Django projects has highlighted the power of simplicity. Frameworks like React still have their place and I use them often, but be brutally honest and ask yourself: -> Is this complexity necessary now? Strategic decision-making about complexity is key.

Overwhelmed with endless requests for new features and updates? Discover how simplicity can transform your product development. In a world obsessed with adding features, successful product development might stem from Via Negativa - the concept of subtraction for improvement and ease of use. - Trim features: Cut non-essentials for simplicity. - Goal-driven: Focus on key objectives. - Simplify choices: Reduce options for user satisfaction. - Choose right partners: Collaborate with supportive teams, avoid negativity. - Drop practices: Cease ineffective methods, prefer lean approaches. - Regular review: Review commitments, discard hindrances. - Risk management: Be cautious in innovation, prevent problems. - Learn: Follow successful examples. Via Negativa in product development means making sure every feature, code, and user interaction is essential. This approach makes products excellent because of a clear aim. In my experience, removing unneeded features has made products better. It's often the things you choose not to include that make your product clear and effective. ‚Üí Have you experienced the power of subtraction in your product development journey? What did you cut to make your product shine?

Aligning your technical capabilities with your product vision can seem daunting. But here's the thing, it doesn't have to be. In my journey through various tech startups, I've discovered that when technology and vision meet, magic happens. Here's how you can make it happen for your startup: - Embrace the Lean Methodology: Begin with a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). This stripped-down version of your product allows you to test how your tech aligns with your vision. It also gives you the opportunity to pivot based on the feedback you receive, reducing risk and conserving resources. - Place the Customer at the Heart of Your Tech and Vision: By building technology around genuine customer needs, you ensure that your product vision is grounded in reality and has the potential for success. - Innovate Rather Than Imitate: Aim for groundbreaking innovation over incremental improvements. This is where your tech and vision become one. The tech you develop should be aimed at creating a product that breaks the mould, not one that fits within it. - Simplify: Traditional business practices often complicate what should be simple processes. When aligning your tech with your product vision, be sure to keep it straightforward. Remove anything that does not contribute to your vision or enhance your tech. - Prepare for Disruption: Stay aware of potentially disruptive technologies. These technologies might align better with your product vision or, conversely, might disrupt the market you're planning to enter. - Rapid Prototyping and Testing: Use rapid prototyping and testing to ensure your tech aligns with your product vision. Swiftly creating a prototype, collecting user feedback, and iterating on the product can save you time and ensure that your product vision is technically feasible. Navigating the intersection of tech and vision is both an art and a science. The above insights will help you make informed decisions, align your tech prowess with your product vision effectively, and navigate your startup journey successfully. What are your thoughts or experiences in aligning technology with a product vision? P.S. If you found this post helpful, please consider liking, commenting, or sharing. It could make a difference for someone else in their startup journey! #startups #productvision #techalignment #innovation #productmanagement

As an entrepreneur and software engineer, I've navigated the challenges of creating scalable, maintainable software solutions. My journey has led me to believe that the architecture of software acts as its backbone, governing its evolution and success. Let me share some insights I've gathered along the way: 1. Picture the Outcome: As echoed by Martin Fowler in "Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture", the heart of an effective software architecture lies in envisioning your software's structural layout and the dynamics of its components. It's the strategic mapping that will make managing software growth less overwhelming. 2. Mentorship Matters: Just as in life, professional mentorship can illuminate our blind spots, guiding our architectural decisions. "Clean Architecture" by Robert C. Martin is akin to a mentor, helping us to uphold the independence of our architecture despite external factors. 3. Architectural Experimentation: Like testing new strategies in a startup, experimenting with diverse architectural styles can yield valuable insights. Stateless design and horizontal scaling could significantly bolster your system's scalability and reliability. 4. Refine Your Architecture: Much like iterative learning in a startup journey, revisiting your software architecture can unveil opportunities for enhancement. As Sam Newman asserts in "Building Microservices", the key lies in designing services that are small, specialized, and loosely coupled. 5. Embrace New Challenges: Scaling startups often face complex data-centric issues. Exploring unfamiliar territories can equip you with the knowledge to address these challenges. 6. Learn from the Masters: Eric Evans, in "Domain-Driven Design", emphasizes a common language bridging business and tech teams‚Äîcrucial advice that resonates deeply in my experience. The wisdom of such industry leaders can be a guiding light on your journey. 7. Time-Bound Decisions: As we often experience in startup life, decisions under time constraints can lead to profound clarity. Aim for an architecture that doesn't only shine today, but has the potential to adapt and evolve in the future. The journey of architecting software solutions is thrilling and rewarding, albeit challenging. Are there any unconventional approaches or strategies that have worked for you? Maybe we could shed some light on the 'underdogs' of architectural styles that don't get as much attention but have helped you tremendously. P.S.
