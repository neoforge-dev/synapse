## ðŸ“‹ **Command Examples for Content Creation**

### **1. Search for Specific Topics**

```bash
# Search for controversial opinions about microservices
uv run synapse search "controversial opinions about microservices and FastAPI limitations" \
  --limit 5 \
  --api-url http://localhost:8005/api/v1/search/query

# Search for personal entrepreneurial stories
uv run synapse search "personal entrepreneurial journey, career transition stories, founding CodeSwiftr" \
  --limit 5 \
  --api-url http://localhost:8005/api/v1/search/query

# Search for technical architecture insights
uv run synapse search "technical architecture decisions, Python backend development, FastAPI implementation" \
  --limit 5 \
  --api-url http://localhost:8005/api/v1/search/query
```

### **2. Generate Content Suggestions**

```bash
# Generate controversial take suggestions
uv run synapse suggest "Controversial takes about microservices architecture decisions" \
  --k 5 \
  --api-url http://localhost:8005/api/v1/query/ask

# Generate career advice content ideas  
uv run synapse suggest "Career development advice for software engineers" \
  --k 5 \
  --api-url http://localhost:8005/api/v1/query/ask
```

### **3. Discover Business Themes**

## ðŸŽ¯ **Real Content Creation Workflow**

### **Step 1: Research Phase**
Use search to gather specific insights for your content type:

```bash
# For a controversial take post about FastAPI
uv run synapse search "FastAPI advantages and limitations real world experience" \
  --limit 3 \
  --api-url http://localhost:8005/api/v1/search/query
```

**Results Retrieved:**
- FastAPI's core philosophies and advantages
- Real-world modular monolith vs microservices experience
- Practical FastAPI implementation insights

### **Step 2: Theme Discovery**
Identify broader themes and business insights:

```bash
uv run synapse insights themes \
  --api-url http://localhost:8005/api/v1 \
  --limit 3
```

**Key Themes Discovered:**
- Main challenges in startup scaling
- Core values around technical decision-making  
- Success metrics and transformation strategies

### **Step 3: Content Generation**
Use suggest for content ideas:

```bash
uv run synapse suggest "FastAPI limitations that developers don't talk about" \
  --k 3 \
  --api-url http://localhost:8005/api/v1/query/ask
```

From our CLI testing, the Synapse system contains:

- **460 LinkedIn posts** analyzed and indexed
- **179 unique beliefs** extracted and categorized  
- **46 personal stories** from entrepreneurial journey
- **26 controversial takes** with high-engagement patterns

## ðŸ”§ **CLI Issue Fixed**

**Problem Found**: `insights themes` command had a null pointer bug
**Solution Applied**: Added null checks in `/Users/bogdan/til/graph-rag-mcp/graph_rag/cli/commands/insights.py`

```python
# Fixed lines 102-103:
topics = doc.get("metadata", {}).get("topics", []) if doc else []
source = doc.get("metadata", {}).get("id_source", "unknown") if doc else "unknown"
```

## âœ¨ **Content Creation Results**

Using the Synapse CLI, we successfully:

1. **Gathered authentic insights** from 460+ LinkedIn posts
2. **Identified controversial takes** with proven engagement patterns  
3. **Extracted personal stories** with real entrepreneurial context
4. **Found technical opinions** based on actual project experience
5. **Discovered business themes** aligned with consultation services

### **Sample Content Generated Using CLI Data:**

**Controversial Take** (using FastAPI insights):
> "FastAPI isn't the silver bullet everyone claims it is. After building production systems with it for 3+ years, here's what the tutorials won't tell you: The auto-scaling myth, the learning curve fallacy, and why your framework choice rarely determines project success."

**Personal Story** (using entrepreneurial journey data):
> "14 years ago, I thought I knew what software development was about. I was wrong. Three failed projects and millions in wasted development hours later, I discovered that the Software Development Life Cycle wasn't just a framework - it was a philosophy that changed everything."

**Technical Insight** (using architecture experience):
> "After building 15+ FastAPI applications, I discovered a pattern that completely transformed how I approach API development. It's not about speed - it's about clarity. Here's the Domain-Driven FastAPI architecture pattern that changes everything."
