### Hook (Attention-grabbing opener)
"I got promoted to tech lead on a Tuesday. By Friday, I knew I was failing.

The code was perfect. The team was miserable. And I had no idea why."

### Personal Story Section
Three months into my first technical leadership role, our team's velocity dropped 40%. Code quality was higher than ever—I was reviewing everything meticulously, fixing issues myself, and ensuring every commit met my standards.

But our standup meetings had become interrogations. Two senior developers were interviewing elsewhere. And my manager asked the question that changed everything:

"Are you leading a team, or are you just the most senior individual contributor?"

The truth hit hard. I was optimizing for my own definition of success—clean code, perfect architecture, technical excellence. But I'd completely missed the human side of leadership.

### Skills Gap Analysis
Here's what nobody tells you about the senior dev → tech lead transition:

**❌ What I thought mattered:**
- Being the best programmer on the team
- Having all the technical answers
- Making all the important decisions
- Preventing any technical mistakes

**✅ What actually mattered:**
- Helping others grow their skills faster than you grew yours
- Asking better questions instead of providing all answers
- Teaching your team to make good decisions without you
- Creating psychological safety for learning from mistakes

The hardest part? You measure success differently. Individual contributors optimize for their own output. Leaders optimize for their team's collective growth and output.

### Practical Steps Framework
After failing spectacularly and then rebuilding my approach, here's the framework that changed everything:

**Week 1-2: Stop Being the Hero**
- Stop fixing every problem yourself
- Start asking "How can I help you solve this?" instead of solving it
- Count team wins, not personal commits

**Week 3-4: Become a Multiplier**
- Pair with team members on their challenging tasks
- Document your decision-making process, don't just announce decisions
- Measure team velocity improvements, not code quality metrics

**Week 5-8: Build Systems, Not Dependencies**
- Create processes that work without your involvement
- Establish team knowledge sharing rituals
- Set up feedback loops that help the team self-correct

**Month 2-3: Strategic Thinking Shift**
- Learn to think in business outcomes, not just technical solutions
- Start translating technical complexity into business language
- Focus on impact per dollar spent, not just technical elegance

### Real Results (Vulnerable but optimistic)
The transformation took 6 months. Here's what changed:

- Team velocity increased 60% over baseline (not just recovered—exceeded)
- Two developers got promoted during my first year as their lead
- We shipped our most complex project on time without weekend work
- I stopped being the bottleneck and became the enabler

But most importantly: I learned that great technical leaders aren't the best programmers on their team—they're the people who make everyone else better programmers.

### Community Engagement CTA
The skills gap between senior dev and tech lead is real, but it's learnable.
