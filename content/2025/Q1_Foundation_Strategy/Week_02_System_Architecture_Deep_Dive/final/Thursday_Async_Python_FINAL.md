## Final Optimized Post

**Async made our API 10x faster and 5x more complex. Here's the balance.**

3 months ago, our FastAPI was serving 100 req/sec. Today: 1,000 req/sec with the same hardware.

**The async journey was brutal. Here's what I wish I knew:**

**ðŸš« Async Python Mistakes That Killed Performance:**

**1. Mixing Sync and Async Incorrectly**
```python
# WRONG - Blocks the event loop
async def get_user(user_id):
    user = requests.get(f"/users/{user_id}")  # Blocking!
    return user.json()

# RIGHT - Keeps the event loop happy
async def get_user(user_id):
    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        response = await client.get(f"/users/{user_id}")
        return response.json()
```

**2. Creating Too Many Database Connections**
```python
# WRONG - Connection pool explosion
async def get_users():
    for user_id in user_ids:
        async with asyncpg.connect() as conn:  # New connection each time!
            user = await conn.fetchrow("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $1", user_id)

# RIGHT - Reuse connections
async def get_users():
    async with asyncpg.create_pool() as pool:
        tasks = [pool.fetchrow("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $1", uid) for uid in user_ids]
        return await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
```

**3. Forgetting to Limit Concurrency**
```python
# WRONG - DDoS your own database
tasks = [process_user(uid) for uid in user_ids]  # 10,000 concurrent tasks!
await asyncio.gather(*tasks)

# RIGHT - Controlled concurrency
semaphore = asyncio.Semaphore(10)
async def limited_process(uid):
    async with semaphore:
        return await process_user(uid)

tasks = [limited_process(uid) for uid in user_ids]
await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
```

**âš¡ Async Patterns That Actually Work:**

**1. The Connection Pool Pattern**
One pool per database, reuse connections, set reasonable limits.

**2. The Semaphore Pattern**  
Control concurrency to avoid overwhelming downstream services.

**3. The Circuit Breaker Pattern**
Fail fast when external services are down.

**4. The Timeout Pattern**
Every async call needs a timeout. No exceptions.

**ðŸŽ¯ Production Async Rules:**

**CPU-Bound = Sync + ThreadPool**
```python
# Don't async CPU work
async def heavy_computation():
    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
    return await loop.run_in_executor(None, cpu_intensive_function)
```

**I/O-Bound = Async All The Way**
Database calls, HTTP requests, file operationsâ€”make them all async.

**Monitor Event Loop Lag**
If your event loop is blocked > 100ms, you're doing it wrong.

**ðŸ”¥ The Performance Numbers:**

**Before Async:**
â†’ 100 req/sec throughput  
â†’ 500ms p95 response time  
â†’ 8 server instances  
â†’ $2,400/month infrastructure  

**After Async (Done Right):**
â†’ 1,000 req/sec throughput  
â†’ 150ms p95 response time  
â†’ 2 server instances  
â†’ $600/month infrastructure  

**The Real Lesson:**
Async isn't a magic performance bullet. It's a tool for I/O concurrency.

Use it for what it's good at. Don't force it where it doesn't belong.

**ðŸ’¡ When NOT to Use Async:**
- CPU-intensive workloads
- Simple CRUD APIs with low traffic
- Teams unfamiliar with async debugging
- Integrating with sync-only libraries

**The debugging complexity is real.** But when you need I/O concurrency, nothing else comes close.

**P.S.** If you're using `time.sleep()` in an async function, we need to talk.
