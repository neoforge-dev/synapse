# Weekend Reading: 5 Technical Leadership Articles That Changed My Perspective

Saturday morning coffee and learning time â˜•

After 15+ years in technical leadership across gaming, healthcare, fintech, and IoT, I've read thousands of articles. But these 5 fundamentally changed how I think about leading technical teams.

Each one taught me something I wish I'd learned earlier in my career.

## 1. "Conway's Law in Practice" by Martin Fowler

**The insight**: Your software architecture will mirror your communication structure whether you plan for it or not.

**What changed for me**: At Ubisoft, we kept fighting our microservices architecture until I realized it perfectly reflected our broken cross-team communication. We fixed the communication first, then the architecture fell into place.

**Key takeaway**: Design your team structure before your software architecture.

## 2. "Architectural Decision Records" by Michael Nygard

**The insight**: Document the *why* behind architectural decisions, not just the *what*.

**What changed for me**: Started using ADRs for every major technical choice. Six months later, we avoided a $2M mistake because we could trace back to why we chose our current approach.

**Key takeaway**: Your future self (and team) will thank you for context, not just conclusions.

## 3. "Choose Boring Technology" by Dan McKinley

**The insight**: Your innovation budget is finite. Spend it wisely.

**What changed for me**: Stopped chasing shiny new frameworks and focused on solving business problems with proven tools. Team velocity increased 40% when we embraced "boring."

**Key takeaway**: Boring technology is often the most innovative choice for business outcomes.

## 4. "The Database That Wasn't" - My $100K MongoDB Lesson

**The insight**: Database choices have 3-year consequences, not 3-month convenience.

**What changed for me**: We chose MongoDB for a project because it was trendy. 18 months later, we spent $100K+ migrating to PostgreSQL when our query patterns became incompatible.

**Key takeaway**: Choose your database for your actual usage patterns, not the marketing materials.

## 5. "Microservices: The Big Lie" by Various Authors

**The insight**: Microservices solve organizational problems, not technical problems.

**What changed for me**: Stopped the failed microservices migration at a fintech startup. Kept the modular monolith, improved team communication. Shipped 3x faster.

**Key takeaway**: If your teams can't work independently, microservices won't help.

## My Reading Pattern

I've noticed something: **The best technical leadership articles aren't about technologyâ€”they're about people, communication, and business alignment.**

The most valuable insights come from:
- War stories with specific failures and lessons
- Business context alongside technical decisions  
- Honest assessment of what actually worked vs. what sounded good
- Frameworks you can apply immediately, not just theory

## Weekend Learning Questions

**What's the last article that fundamentally changed how you approach technical leadership?**

And more importantly: **What's one insight you learned the hard way that you wish you'd read about first?**

## Bonus Weekend Reading

If you're still caffeinated and curious:
- "The Phoenix Project" - Still the best book on DevOps culture
- "Staff Engineer" by Will Larson - Career progression beyond senior
- "Building Microservices" by Sam Newman - But read it critically
- Any post by Charity Majors on observability and team dynamics

The best discussions happen when we all share what we've learned.
