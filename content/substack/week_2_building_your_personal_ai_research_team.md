9 months ago, I shared my initial excitement about Bing AI and Edge Dev. Like many in the tech world, I was captivated by their innovative features and potential to disrupt our workflows. Here's an update on my experience and some reflections on tech trends: 1. Intermittent use over time: While I still use Bing AI occasionally, especially when exploring new topics, it hasn't become the daily tool I anticipated. This is a common trajectory for many new tech solutions; initial excitement gives way to selective, practical usage. 2. Natural language processing: Still impressive: The natural language capabilities of Bing AI remain impressive. It's a helpful resource for quick searches, summaries, and translations, though it hasn't completely replaced traditional search methods. 3. Edge Dev features: Useful but limited: Edge Dev's features like the PDF Reader and Collections have been useful, enhancing productivity in certain aspects. However, limitations like regional availability of Image Creator highlight the uneven rollout of tech advancements. 4. Reflecting on tech hype cycles: This journey with Bing AI and Edge Dev is a reminder of the tech hype cycle. We often see a surge of interest followed by a normalization of how and when we use new technologies. 5. Balancing enthusiasm with practicality: As a tech professional, it's essential to balance excitement for new tools with practical considerations of their utility in our daily workflows. 6. The future of AI and browser integration: Bing AI's integration with Edge Dev points towards an exciting future where AI is more seamlessly integrated into our browsing experience. The full impact of this remains to be seen. ‚Üí Have you been using Bing AI or Edge over the past months? Has your usage changed since their initial launch?

Imagine steering your startup's journey from the ground up to a successful scale-up, without worrying about your technology collapsing under the pressure of growth. Is it possible? Absolutely! Here are 10 valuable insights that every startup and scale-up decision-maker should consider when designing their software architecture. 1. Set a Clear Vision: Prioritize your technological roadmap based on your business vision, not on specific features. The roadmap should be flexible and adjustable according to market changes and feedback. 2. Engineers are your Innovation Engine: Engineers understand what's technologically possible and feasible. Encourage their input and foster a culture of innovation within the team. 3. Value Over Output: Concentrate on generating value rather than producing a high volume of output. Aim for outcome-driven development to ensure your efforts bring tangible benefits. 4. Dance with Data: Use data as a source of inspiration for new features and improvements. Make it accessible and understandable to everyone in the team. 5. Test, Iterate, Improve: Understand that most features will need several iterations before they provide significant value. Adopt a culture of testing, learning, and improving. 6. Embrace Uncertainty: Business cases are necessary, but remember they're based on assumptions. Be ready to pivot as you gather more data and insights. 7. Software Development is a Team Sport: Break the silos. Developers, product managers, and other stakeholders should work together from the early stages of product development. 8. Redefine the Role of Product Managers: Modern product managers should act as product leaders, focusing on value delivery rather than just gathering requirements. 9. Design is a Crucial Player: Design isn't secondary‚Äîit plays a pivotal role in user experience. Involve your design team in the product development process from the get-go. üîü Ethics in Product Development: In the era of increasing tech scrutiny, considering the ethical implications of your product is not an option‚Äîit's a necessity. Building software is like constructing a building; without a solid architectural plan, it may collapse under pressure.

I've often found myself in the trenches of 'technical debt', a common byproduct of the MVP-building process. However, recently I've come to appreciate a fresh perspective - viewing technical debt as an opportunity to build 'technical wealth'. Technical wealth is about transforming our liabilities into assets, about gaining productivity that compounds over time. It's about remodeling our software, not just rewriting it. It's about breaking monolithic apps into micro-services, decoupling features, and establishing automated testing. It's about fostering a culture that prioritizes resolving technical debt and making our engineers more productive. Here are some strategies that have helped us manage technical debt and build technical wealth: 1. Identify and Assess: Recognize areas where technical debt has accumulated and prioritize them based on their impact on your product. 2. Plan and Implement: Develop a comprehensive plan to tackle the technical debt, including timelines, resources, and budgets. 3. Software Remodeling: Instead of rewriting your code from scratch, consider remodeling it. This could involve breaking monolithic apps into micro-services, decoupling features, refreshing branding, establishing automated testing, and refactoring codebases. 4. Automated Testing and Continuous Delivery: Implement automated testing to validate your system and continuous delivery to automate delivery-related tasks. This will help you deploy changes quickly and efficiently. 5. Cultural Upgrades: Foster a culture that prioritizes resolving technical debt. This could involve resisting the urge to reward late-night work, encouraging collaboration techniques, and putting empathy at the center of everything you do. 6. Hire Menders: Contrary to popular belief, there are engineers who enjoy working on legacy code. These 'menders' are detail-oriented and love solving challenging problems. Find them, hire them, and give them the autonomy and tools they need to thrive. 7. Embrace Stability: As your startup grows, there will come a time when stability becomes as important as growth. This doesn't mean growth ends, but rather that you have the people and processes in place to build technical wealth and spend it on the right priorities. By adopting these strategies, we can turn technical debt into technical wealth, ensuring our product remains on track for success. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts! At what point in your startup's growth did you start to focus on stability? How did this shift impact your approach to managing technical debt? #technicaldebt #techleadership #startups #scaleups #techfounders

Adaptability and continuous learning are key skills in the tech landscape, especially for software engineers navigating the diverse and dynamic tech stacks today. More than just knowing different languages or frameworks, it's about the ability to learn, adapt, and apply these skills to real-world problems. Here are some insights into my tech journey from the last year. In a fintech project, we were required to transition from a Python/Django framework to Azure Kubernetes Cluster (AKS). Despite facing Docker configurations, new API endpoints, and technical debt, the switch ultimately streamlined the development process and increased efficiency. A clear win for adaptability! In another instance, working with a Machine Learning team, I juggled various tech stacks from FastAPI/Flask to RabbitMQ, Kafka, and Jenkins pipelines. Here, focusing on delivering robust and efficient ML solution deployments reinforced the importance of understanding and working with multiple tech stacks. These experiences have taught me that in today's fast-paced tech world, it's good to be a "generalist" software engineer. While having deep knowledge in your core area is important, a wide range of tech skills can open up new opportunities and add more value to projects. However, it's not just about how many programming languages or technologies you know. I've learned that the key to thriving in this dynamic environment is the ability to learn new things, adapt quickly to changes, and apply your skills to solve real-world problems. I'd love to hear your thoughts. Do you see more value in being a software engineer generalist or a specialist? How do you approach continuous learning in the tech world? #softwareengineering #python #adaptability #softwaredevelopment #deliveringvalue
