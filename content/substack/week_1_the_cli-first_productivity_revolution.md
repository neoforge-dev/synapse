As an entrepreneur and tech enthusiast, I've observed that DevOps extends beyond a set of practices or tools. Here are 7 pivotal ways to foster the DevOps culture: 1. Shared Responsibility: DevOps is about mutual accountability. Encourage open communication and shared responsibility. It's about writing the ending (successful delivery) first and then building the body (the processes). 2. Embrace Risk: Don't fear failure. Instead, learn from it. Experiment and encourage your team to do the same. It's akin to writing hooks without the body, trying out new things, and learning from the outcome. 3. Visualize Work: The workflow should be visible and transparent to everyone involved. As if you're writing the body without the hooks, you need to have a clear understanding of how processes work and where improvements can be made. 4. Small Batch Sizes: Split work into small, manageable batches. It reduces risk, accelerates feedback, and improves adaptability. It's like writing on a time limit, focusing on the essential and cutting the fluff. 5. Continuous Learning: Embrace the principles of flow, feedback, and constant learning, similar to writing like other creators. Learn from each other and create a culture that values knowledge sharing. 6. Automation: Wherever possible, automate. It reduces manual effort, minimizes errors, and speeds up delivery. This practice resembles rewriting (improving) other people's content, using established tools to enhance your processes. 7. Feedback Loop: Use monitoring and logging tools for real-time feedback. Record your operations, then rewrite (improve) your processes based on this data. Embracing the DevOps culture can be a game-changer, leading to improved productivity and customer satisfaction. If you're already practicing DevOps or contemplating a shift, let's exchange experiences. Drop a comment below! üëá P.S.

Imagine steering your startup's journey from the ground up to a successful scale-up, without worrying about your technology collapsing under the pressure of growth. Is it possible? Absolutely! Here are 10 valuable insights that every startup and scale-up decision-maker should consider when designing their software architecture. 1. Set a Clear Vision: Prioritize your technological roadmap based on your business vision, not on specific features. The roadmap should be flexible and adjustable according to market changes and feedback. 2. Engineers are your Innovation Engine: Engineers understand what's technologically possible and feasible. Encourage their input and foster a culture of innovation within the team. 3. Value Over Output: Concentrate on generating value rather than producing a high volume of output. Aim for outcome-driven development to ensure your efforts bring tangible benefits. 4. Dance with Data: Use data as a source of inspiration for new features and improvements. Make it accessible and understandable to everyone in the team. 5. Test, Iterate, Improve: Understand that most features will need several iterations before they provide significant value. Adopt a culture of testing, learning, and improving. 6. Embrace Uncertainty: Business cases are necessary, but remember they're based on assumptions. Be ready to pivot as you gather more data and insights. 7. Software Development is a Team Sport: Break the silos. Developers, product managers, and other stakeholders should work together from the early stages of product development. 8. Redefine the Role of Product Managers: Modern product managers should act as product leaders, focusing on value delivery rather than just gathering requirements. 9. Design is a Crucial Player: Design isn't secondary‚Äîit plays a pivotal role in user experience. Involve your design team in the product development process from the get-go. üîü Ethics in Product Development: In the era of increasing tech scrutiny, considering the ethical implications of your product is not an option‚Äîit's a necessity. Building software is like constructing a building; without a solid architectural plan, it may collapse under pressure. As startup and scale-up leaders, our role is to ensure our teams are building on a solid, scalable, and sustainable foundation.

Unlock 10% more productivity as a senior software engineer with the power of CLI tools. After dedicating three years to mastering these text-only tools, I experienced a significant improvement in my efficiency and confidence. Here's a list of 15 essential CLI tools you need to know. Start your deliberate practice regime today and watch your productivity soar! Three years ago, I set a goal to become more comfortable with text-only CLI tools and began a deliberate practice regime. This involved building a workflow with Vim, Tux, and oh-my-zsh. The results have been remarkable - I've noticed a significant improvement in my productivity and efficiency, and I feel confident tackling even the most complex and challenging projects. Here are some key CLI tools that I've found particularly useful: cat is used to read, print, and combine files. echo displays a line of text on standard output or in a file. sed is a popular stream editor used for filtering and substituting in files and text data streams. sort sorts text files and output streams in ascending or descending order. uniq eliminates duplicate entries in a text file. paste combines fields from different files, or extracts and combines lines from multiple sources. join combines lines from two files based on a common field. split breaks up a large file into equal-sized segments. grep searches text files and data streams for patterns and can be used with regular expressions. tee saves a copy of standard output to a file while still displaying at the terminal. wc (word count) displays the number of lines, words, and characters in a file or group of files. cut extracts columns from a file. less views files a page at a time and allows scrolling in both directions. head displays the first few lines of a file or data stream on standard output (10 by default). tail displays the last few lines of a file or data stream on standard output (10 by default). Becoming proficient with CLI tools is an invaluable skill for any senior software engineer, and I encourage you to start your own deliberate practice regime to improve your own proficiency. Share your experience and insights on the tools that have made the biggest impact on your productivity and efficiency.

Looking to turn your vision into efficient, powerful software? Simplify Your Code, Amplify Your Results Coding is a bit like cooking - Too much spice, and it's overwhelming. Just right, and it's delightful. Let me share a secret: Test-Driven Development (or TDD) is a useful tool, but it isn't the "magic potion" for every project. The real strength of software? Its ability to adapt and evolve. Here's what I've learned in 14 years working in the tech industry: * Flexibility: The best methodology changes from project to project. Learn. Adapt. Apply. * Practice: Start small. Tackle challenges. Grow your skills. * Tailor: Each project is unique. Adjust your approach accordingly. * Cultivate: Foster a team culture that values continuous testing and feedback. * Evolution: Stay updated. New tools, techniques emerge daily. Keep learning. The result? Clear goals, streamlined tasks, and an efficient process that delivers. If you're a startup or non-tech business aiming to up your software game, let's chat. Just DM me 'efficiency', and let's bring your vision to life. P.S. Repost if this is useful ‚ôªÔ∏è --- üîîFollow me for updates and new posts üîócodeswiftr dot com üñäÔ∏èMedium: @bogdan_veliscu

I've often found myself in the trenches of 'technical debt', a common byproduct of the MVP-building process. However, recently I've come to appreciate a fresh perspective - viewing technical debt as an opportunity to build 'technical wealth'. Technical wealth is about transforming our liabilities into assets, about gaining productivity that compounds over time. It's about remodeling our software, not just rewriting it. It's about breaking monolithic apps into micro-services, decoupling features, and establishing automated testing. It's about fostering a culture that prioritizes resolving technical debt and making our engineers more productive. Here are some strategies that have helped us manage technical debt and build technical wealth: 1. Identify and Assess: Recognize areas where technical debt has accumulated and prioritize them based on their impact on your product. 2. Plan and Implement: Develop a comprehensive plan to tackle the technical debt, including timelines, resources, and budgets. 3. Software Remodeling: Instead of rewriting your code from scratch, consider remodeling it. This could involve breaking monolithic apps into micro-services, decoupling features, refreshing branding, establishing automated testing, and refactoring codebases. 4. Automated Testing and Continuous Delivery: Implement automated testing to validate your system and continuous delivery to automate delivery-related tasks. This will help you deploy changes quickly and efficiently. 5. Cultural Upgrades: Foster a culture that prioritizes resolving technical debt. This could involve resisting the urge to reward late-night work, encouraging collaboration techniques, and putting empathy at the center of everything you do. 6. Hire Menders: Contrary to popular belief, there are engineers who enjoy working on legacy code. These 'menders' are detail-oriented and love solving challenging problems. Find them, hire them, and give them the autonomy and tools they need to thrive. 7. Embrace Stability: As your startup grows, there will come a time when stability becomes as important as growth. This doesn't mean growth ends, but rather that you have the people and processes in place to build technical wealth and spend it on the right priorities. By adopting these strategies, we can turn technical debt into technical wealth, ensuring our product remains on track for success. Looking forward to hearing your thoughts! At what point in your startup's growth did you start to focus on stability? How did this shift impact your approach to managing technical debt? #technicaldebt #techleadership #startups #scaleups #techfounders

Here's my list of 15 essential CLI tools that can transform your workflow too: 1. `cat` - A versatile tool for reading, printing, and combining files. 2. `echo` - Perfect for displaying lines of text or directing them into files. 3. `sed` - The go-to stream editor for filtering and substituting text. 4. `sort` - Sorts text files and streams, a fundamental for data organization. 5. `uniq` - Eliminates duplicate entries, essential for clean data. 6. `paste` - Combines fields from different files, streamlining data integration. 7. `join` - Merges lines from two files based on a common field. 8. `split` - Breaks up large files into manageable segments. 9. `grep` - The powerhouse for searching patterns in text, using regular expressions. 10. `tee` - Saves output to a file while still displaying it in the terminal. 11. `wc` (word count) - Counts lines, words, and characters, crucial for text analysis. 12. `cut` - Extracts columns from files, ideal for data parsing. 13. `less` - Allows for comfortable file viewing and scrolling. 14. `head` - Shows the first few lines of a file, great for previews. 15. `tail` - Displays the last few lines, useful for log monitoring. By integrating these CLI tools into your daily routine, you'll experience a significant improvement in efficiency.
