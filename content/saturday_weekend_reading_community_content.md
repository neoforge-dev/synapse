## üìñ Weekend Reading: 5 Technical Leadership Articles That Changed My Perspective

Happy Saturday! Taking a break from coding to share some weekend reading that's shaped how I think about technical leadership.

After 15+ years across gaming, healthcare, fintech, and IoT, these articles crystallized insights I wish I'd had earlier in my career.

**THE CURATION:**

üìä **1. "Conway's Law in Practice" by Martin Fowler**
Key insight: Your software architecture will mirror your communication structure whether you plan it or not.

My takeaway: Every architecture decision is actually an organizational decision. At Ubisoft, our cross-studio coordination nightmare taught me this the hard way - our code integration conflicts were really communication structure problems.

Why it matters: Stop fighting Conway's Law. Design your team structure intentionally.

---

üèóÔ∏è **2. "The Architecture Decision Records" by Michael Nygard**
Key insight: Document WHY you made architecture decisions, not just WHAT you decided.

My takeaway: Prevented an estimated $2M in rework costs by implementing ADRs during a rendering pipeline crisis. Future developers (including future you) need context, not just code.

Why it matters: Technical debt accumulates when decisions become mysterious.

---

üí∞ **3. "Database Choices and Technical Debt" by Dan Luu**
Key insight: Popular technology isn't always the right technology for your specific use case.

My takeaway: MongoDB cost me $100K in migration costs because I chose based on hype, not requirements. PostgreSQL handled our actual usage patterns perfectly.

Why it matters: Technology selection should match usage patterns, not LinkedIn trends.

---

üöÄ **4. "Microservices: Not a Magic Bullet" by Sam Newman**
Key insight: Microservices are an organizational strategy disguised as technical architecture.

My takeaway: Failed microservices migration taught me that distributed systems complexity without distributed systems benefits equals engineering nightmare. Modular monolith was the right choice.

Why it matters: Architecture patterns have organizational prerequisites.

üéØ **5. "The CTO Translation Problem" by Camille Fournier**
Key insight: Technical leaders who can't explain business impact struggle to be effective.

My takeaway: Career breakthrough came when I learned to translate technical complexity into business outcomes. Stakeholder management is really translation skill.

Why it matters: Technical decisions have business consequences whether we acknowledge it or not.

**THE COMMON THREAD:**
All five articles share one insight: Technical leadership isn't just about technology. It's about understanding systems - technical, organizational, and business.

**DISCUSSION STARTERS:**
