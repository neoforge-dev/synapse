**Endpoints:**
- `/features/hot-takes/` - Hot takes generation
- `/features/brand-safety/` - Brand safety validation
- `/features/content-analysis/` - Advanced content analysis
- `/features/experiments/` - Feature experiments

**Performance Target:** <300ms average response time
**Justification:** Specialized AI features may require more processing time

### 7. **enterprise_api.py** (NEW - Enterprise capabilities)
**Endpoints:**
- `/enterprise/analytics/` - Advanced analytics
- `/enterprise/integrations/` - Third-party integrations
- `/enterprise/compliance/` - Compliance features
