## ðŸ”„ Integrated Workflow: Synapse + Sub-Agents

### **Phase 1: Intelligence Gathering (Powered by Synapse)**

```bash
# Weekly intelligence analysis using Synapse
claude

# Query historical performance
> Query Synapse for top 10 performing LinkedIn posts in the last 90 days with engagement metrics

# Extract successful patterns
> Use Synapse's CrossPlatformCorrelator to identify content patterns that drove business inquiries

# Analyze audience evolution
> Show me audience growth patterns and demographic shifts from Synapse analytics

# Mine untapped stories
> Use Synapse to find personal experiences I haven't used in content yet

# Competitive intelligence
> Query Synapse for industry content trends and gaps we can fill
```

### **Phase 2: Strategic Planning (Content Strategist + Synapse)**

```bash
# Enhanced planning with real data
> Use content-strategist to create next week's content plan based on these Synapse insights: [paste intelligence gathered]

# Validate against historical performance
> Cross-reference the proposed topics with Synapse data on similar content performance

# Identify optimal story matches
> Use story-miner to query Synapse for relevant personal experiences for each planned topic
```

### **Phase 3: Content Creation (Multi-Agent + Synapse)**

```bash
# Example: Creating Tuesday's Technical Deep Dive

# Step 1: Historical context
> Query Synapse for previous posts about microservices vs monoliths and their performance

# Step 2: Technical framework
> Use technical-architect to create a controversial take on modular monoliths, incorporating insights from Synapse about what resonated before

# Step 3: Personal story integration
> Use story-miner to find specific examples from my fintech scaling experience related to this architecture decision

# Step 4: Voice optimization
> Use bogdan-voice to ensure this matches my authentic style, referencing successful patterns from Synapse

# Step 5: Engagement optimization
> Use engagement-optimizer to enhance based on Synapse's analysis of high-performing technical debates
```

# Business development correlation
> Synapse analyze: "Which content topics generated the most consultation inquiries in Q4"

# Audience intelligence
> Synapse query: "Extract audience pain points from comments on my top 20 posts"

# Competitive gaps
> Synapse analyze: "Compare my content topics with industry leaders and identify uncovered areas"
```

### **Story Mining Queries**

```bash
# Untold experiences
> Synapse search: "Find all personal experiences mentioned in documents but not used in LinkedIn content"

# Success metrics extraction
> Synapse query: "Extract all quantifiable outcomes from my project experiences (cost savings, performance improvements)"

# Failure stories
> Synapse search: "Find learning moments and failures that demonstrate vulnerability and growth"

# Technical decisions
> Synapse analyze: "List all architecture decisions I've made with their business outcomes"
```

### **Optimization Intelligence**

```bash
# Engagement pattern analysis
> Synapse analyze: "What content elements correlate with high engagement (questions, metrics, controversy)"

# Timing optimization
> Synapse query: "Show engagement rates by day of week and time of day for technical content"

# Adjust based on predictions
> Use content-strategist to revise the weekly plan prioritizing high-prediction-score topics

# A/B test preparation
> Generate 3 headline variations for the highest-scoring topic using engagement patterns
```

### **2. Real-Time Optimization Loop**

```bash
# Monday morning check
> Synapse analyze: "How is today's post performing compared to similar Monday posts?"

# Mid-week adjustment
> Based on Monday-Tuesday performance, should we adjust Wednesday's planned topic?

# Friday retrospective
> Use Synapse to analyze this week's content performance and identify improvement areas
```

### **3. Cross-Platform Content Correlation**

```bash
# Content recycling intelligence
> Use CrossPlatformCorrelator to identify high-performing content suitable for other platforms

# Platform-specific optimization
> How should I adapt this LinkedIn post for Twitter while maintaining impact?

# Content evolution tracking
> Show me how this core idea evolved from Notion note to LinkedIn post to blog article
```
