print(f"Overall Resonance: {analysis.overall_resonance_score:.3f}")
print(f"Resonance Level: {analysis.resonance_level.value}")
print(f"Engagement Prediction: {analysis.engagement_prediction:.3f}")
```

### Finding Best Audience for Content

```python
from graph_rag.core.content_audience_resonance import find_best_audience_for_content

# Find optimal audiences for your content
matches = await find_best_audience_for_content(
    content="Your content",
    audience_segments=[segment1, segment2, segment3]
)

for match in matches:
    print(f"Audience: {match.audience_segment_id}")
    print(f"Resonance: {match.resonance_score:.3f}")
    print(f"Quality: {match.match_quality}")
```

### Getting Optimization Recommendations

```python
from graph_rag.core.content_audience_resonance import optimize_content_for_audience

# Get real-time optimization recommendations
recommendations = await optimize_content_for_audience(
    content="Your content",
    target_audience=audience_segment,
    current_performance={"engagement_rate": 0.15, "reach": 0.3}
)

for rec in recommendations:
    print(f"{rec.title} (Priority: {rec.priority})")
    print(f"Impact: {rec.expected_impact:.3f}")
    print(f"Actions: {rec.specific_actions}")
```

## Scoring Components

### Component Weights (Default)
- **Demographic**: 20% - Age, industry, experience alignment
- **Behavioral**: 25% - Engagement patterns, content preferences
- **Psychographic**: 25% - Values, interests, personality fit
- **Content Complexity**: 15% - Sophistication level matching
- **Platform Optimization**: 10% - Platform-specific formatting
- **Temporal Relevance**: 5% - Timing and trending factors

### Resonance Levels
- **Poor** (0.0 - 0.2): Significant mismatch, major optimization needed
- **Weak** (0.2 - 0.4): Some alignment, requires improvements
- **Moderate** (0.4 - 0.6): Decent fit, optimization opportunities exist
- **Strong** (0.6 - 0.8): Good resonance, minor optimizations
- **Excellent** (0.8 - 1.0): Outstanding alignment, minimal changes needed

## Advanced Features

### Batch Processing
Process multiple content-audience combinations efficiently:

```python
pairs = [(content1, audience1), (content2, audience2), ...]
matches = await scorer.batch_analyze_content_audience_matches(pairs)
```

### Real-Time Optimization
Get immediate optimization suggestions:

```python
recommendations = await scorer.get_real_time_optimization_recommendations(
    content, audience_segment, current_performance
)
```

### Platform-Specific Analysis
Optimize for specific social media platforms:

```python
# LinkedIn optimization
analysis = await analyze_content_audience_resonance(
    content, audience, platform=Platform.LINKEDIN
)

# Twitter optimization  
analysis = await analyze_content_audience_resonance(
    content, audience, platform=Platform.TWITTER
)
```

## Configuration

### Customizing Component Weights

```python
scorer = ResonanceScorer()
scorer.component_weights = {
    ResonanceComponent.DEMOGRAPHIC: 0.15,
    ResonanceComponent.BEHAVIORAL: 0.30,
    ResonanceComponent.PSYCHOGRAPHIC: 0.30,
    ResonanceComponent.CONTENT_COMPLEXITY: 0.15,
    ResonanceComponent.PLATFORM_OPTIMIZATION: 0.05,
    ResonanceComponent.TEMPORAL_RELEVANCE: 0.05
}
```

### Setting Confidence Thresholds

```python
RESONANCE_CONFIG = {
    "confidence_thresholds": {
        "high": 0.8,
        "medium": 0.6,
        "low": 0.4
    }
}
```

## Data Models

## Performance Considerations

### Async Processing
All major operations are async for non-blocking execution:

```python
# All these operations are async
analysis = await analyze_content_audience_resonance(...)
matches = await find_best_audience_for_content(...)
recommendations = await optimize_content_for_audience(...)
```

### Caching
The system supports caching for:
- Concept extraction results
- Audience segment analysis
- Platform optimization rules

### Batch Operations
Use batch processing for multiple analyses:

```python
# More efficient than individual calls
matches = await scorer.batch_analyze_content_audience_matches(pairs)
```

## Integration Examples

### With Viral Prediction Engine

```python
from graph_rag.core.viral_prediction_engine import ViralPredictionEngine

viral_engine = ViralPredictionEngine()
viral_prediction = await viral_engine.predict_viral_potential(content)

analysis = await analyze_content_audience_resonance(
    content, audience_segment, viral_prediction=viral_prediction
)
```

### With Concept Extraction

```python
from graph_rag.core.concept_extractor import LinkedInConceptExtractor

extractor = LinkedInConceptExtractor()
concepts = await extractor.extract_concepts(content)

analysis = await analyze_content_audience_resonance(
    content, audience_segment, content_concepts=concepts
)
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Use Comprehensive Audience Profiles
Ensure audience segments have complete demographic, behavioral, and psychographic data for accurate resonance analysis.

### 2. Include Concept Analysis
Always provide extracted concepts for more accurate resonance scoring.

### 3. Platform-Specific Optimization
Specify the target platform for platform-specific optimization recommendations.

### 4. Monitor Performance
Use current performance metrics to get personalized optimization recommendations.

### 5. Batch Processing for Scale
Use batch operations when analyzing multiple content-audience combinations.

### 6. Regular Recalibration
Periodically update audience segments and resonance weights based on performance data.

## Error Handling

The system includes comprehensive error handling:

```python
try:
    analysis = await analyze_content_audience_resonance(content, audience)
    if analysis.confidence_score < 0.5:
        logger.warning("Low confidence in resonance analysis")
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Resonance analysis failed: {str(e)}")
    # Fallback to default recommendations
```

## Monitoring and Metrics

### Key Metrics to Track
- Overall resonance scores by content type
- Component performance (demographic, behavioral, psychographic)
