## **üìã IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH & CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS**

### **Pragmatic Senior Engineer Methodology**
Apply these principles throughout all epic implementation:

#### **Pareto Principle Application**  
- **80/20 Focus**: Identify 20% of work delivering 80% of business value
- **Must-Have First**: Complete core user journeys before nice-to-have features
- **Revenue Priority**: When uncertain, ask "Does this directly serve pipeline protection/growth?"

#### **Test-Driven Development (Non-Negotiable)**
```
For Every Feature:
1. Write failing test defining expected behavior
2. Implement minimal code to pass the test  
3. Refactor while keeping tests green
4. Maintain >90% coverage for critical business paths
```

#### **Clean Architecture Patterns**
- **Separation of Concerns**: Data, domain, presentation layers distinct
- **Dependency Injection**: Maintain testability (use existing graph_rag/api/dependencies.py patterns)
- **Clear Interfaces**: Follow established patterns in graph_rag/core/interfaces.py

#### **Implementation Workflow**
```
After Each Significant Change:
1. Run affected tests immediately
2. Refactor code smells before proceeding  
3. Commit with descriptive message linking to epic requirements
4. Continue to next highest priority item
```
