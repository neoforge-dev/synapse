project-orchestrator: Epic coordination and dependency management
```

### **Subagent Utilization Strategy for Context Management**

**LESSONS LEARNED from Authentication Success:**
- qa-test-guardian achieved 100% authentication reliability (54/54 core JWT tests + 40/40 router tests)
- backend-engineer resolved all authentication system issues systematically
- Subagent coordination prevented context loss and ensured comprehensive testing

**DEPLOY SPECIALIZED AGENTS FOR EPIC 2:**

**backend-engineer** - **IMMEDIATE DEPLOYMENT REQUIRED**
```
Mission: Lead database consolidation with zero business disruption
Week 1: Database architecture audit & Core Business PostgreSQL migration
Week 2: Analytics & Revenue Intelligence database consolidation  
Week 3: API router consolidation (18 → 8-10) with maintained functionality
Week 4: Integration testing & performance validation
Success Criteria: 70% database reduction + 44% API simplification + <100ms queries
```

**devops-deployer** - **PARALLEL DEPLOYMENT**
```
Mission: Production infrastructure & performance optimization
Week 1: PostgreSQL production setup with connection pooling & backup systems
Week 2-3: Performance monitoring & optimization achieving <100ms query targets  
Week 4: Load testing & scalability validation supporting 10x capacity growth
Success Criteria: Enterprise-grade reliability + 99.5% uptime maintained
```

**qa-test-guardian** - **CONTINUOUS DEPLOYMENT**
```  
Mission: Quality assurance & business continuity protection
Ongoing: Comprehensive testing preventing business pipeline disruption during consolidation
Data integrity validation throughout all database migrations ensuring 100% accuracy
API functionality testing during router consolidation maintaining enterprise reliability
End-to-end workflow validation protecting $555K consultation pipeline access
Success Criteria: Zero consultation opportunities lost + maintained test coverage
```

**project-orchestrator** - **COORDINATION ROLE**
```
Mission: Epic coordination & risk management
Coordinate parallel database migration with API consolidation minimizing timeline
Manage dependencies ensuring Epic 3 (AI Analytics) ready for execution post-Epic 2
Risk mitigation ensuring zero business disruption during consolidation activities
Success Criteria: On-time Epic 2 completion + smooth Epic 3 transition
```

## **📋 FINAL SUCCESS VALIDATION**

**Upon Epic 2 Completion, Validate:**
- ✅ 70% database reduction: 10+ SQLite → 3 PostgreSQL with zero data loss
- ✅ 44% API simplification: 18 → 8-10 routers maintaining 100% functionality  
- ✅ <100ms database queries: PostgreSQL performance optimization achieved
- ✅ Business continuity: $555K pipeline protected throughout consolidation
- ✅ Growth enablement: Unified analytics architecture ready for 20-30% pipeline growth

**Commit & Document:** Update docs/PLAN.md with completion status, hand off to Epic 3 execution

**Context Preservation:** All subagent work documented preventing knowledge loss for Epic 3-5 execution

### **Success Indicators (Confirm Before Proceeding)**
- **✅ Dashboard Execution**: automation_dashboard.py runs successfully showing $555K pipeline data
- **✅ System Health**: make install-dev && make up completes without errors
- **✅ Authentication Stability**: All 29 auth tests passing consistently
- **✅ Business Data Access**: Pipeline value, inquiry tracking, alert system all accessible

**Execute with confidence. The foundation is solid, the plan is comprehensive, and the business impact is substantial. Begin with import resolution, proceed through Epic 2 systematically, and commit when significant milestones complete.**
