# Cursor Agent Handoff: Synapse Graph-RAG Critical Fixes

You are taking over a Python Graph-RAG project with **CRITICAL ENTITY EXTRACTION FAILURE** that must be fixed immediately. The system has solid infrastructure but zero knowledge graph functionality due to broken entity extraction.

## 🚨 CRITICAL SITUATION

**ZERO entities extracted from 154 processed documents** - the entire knowledge graph value proposition is broken.

## 📊 Current System State

### What's Working ✅
- **Infrastructure:** Memgraph (port 7777), FastAPI (port 8888), custom configuration
- **Document Ingestion:** 154/1,450 documents processed, 3,314 chunks created
- **Basic Relationships:** 4,222 MENTIONS, 3,314 CONTAINS relationships
- **Analysis Tools:** Working visualization and analytics scripts
- **CLI Pipeline:** discover → parse → store working

### What's Broken ❌
- **Entity Extraction:** 0 entities from 154 documents (CRITICAL)
- **Vector Store:** Using mock 10-dim embeddings (no semantic search)
- **Query Tool:** Circular import issues prevent usage
- **Batch Ingestion:** Stopped at 154/1,450 documents

## 🎯 YOUR IMMEDIATE MISSION

### Priority 1: Fix Entity Extraction (CRITICAL)

**Root Cause Identified:** `IngestionService` has entity extractor injected but **NEVER CALLS IT**

**Location:** `graph_rag/services/ingestion.py` - method `ingest_document()`

**What to do:**
1. **Analyze the current ingestion flow:**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/bogdan/til/graph-rag-mcp
   grep -r "entity_extractor" graph_rag/services/ingestion.py
   ```

2. **Identify where entity extraction should be called:**
   - Look for entity_extractor parameter in IngestionService.__init__()
   - Find where it should be used in ingest_document() method
   - Current flow: Document → Chunks → Storage (MISSING: Entity Extraction)

3. **Implement entity extraction integration:**
   - Add entity extraction step after chunk creation
   - Create entity-chunk MENTIONS relationships
   - Store entities in graph repository

4. **Test the fix:**
   ```bash
   # Should show >0 entities after fix
   SYNAPSE_MEMGRAPH_PORT=7777 python analyze_knowledge_base.py
   ```

**Expected Results:**
- Extract 500+ entities from existing 154 documents
- Create entity-chunk relationships
- Enable knowledge graph functionality

### Priority 2: Enable Real Vector Embeddings

**Root Cause:** Using `MockEmbeddingService` with dummy vectors

**Location:** `graph_rag/api/dependencies.py` - embedding service factory

**What to do:**
1. **Replace mock with real embeddings:**
   - Configure sentence-transformers service properly
   - Use real embeddings (384-dimensional)
   - Update vector store configuration

2. **Fix query tool circular imports:**
   - Located in `query_knowledge_base.py`
   - Resolve GraphRAG engine import cycle
   - Enable semantic search

### Priority 3: Complete Data Ingestion

**Issue:** Batch ingestion stopped at 154/1,450 documents

**What to do:**
1. **Check batch ingestion status:**
   ```bash
   ps aux | grep -E "(synapse|python.*batch)"
   ```

2. **Restart/complete ingestion:**
   ```bash
   ./batch_ingest.sh  # If stopped
   ```

3. **Monitor progress and fix any issues**

### Test Entity Extraction Directly:
```bash
# Test entity extractor in isolation
python -c "
from graph_rag.core.entity_extractor import SpacyEntityExtractor
extractor = SpacyEntityExtractor()
result = extractor.extract('Apple Inc. is located in Cupertino, California.')
print(f'Entities found: {len(result)}')
for entity in result:
    print(f'  {entity.text} ({entity.label})')
"
```

## 🛠️ Technical Context

### Architecture Overview:
```
CLI Commands → IngestionService → [BROKEN: Entity Extraction] → Graph Store
                                                              ↓
Vector Store ← [BROKEN: Mock Embeddings] ← Document Processor
```

### Current Data Flow (BROKEN):
```
Document → Chunks → Basic Relationships → Storage
           ↓
    [MISSING: Entity Extraction]
           ↓
    [MISSING: Entity-Chunk Links]
```

### Expected Data Flow (AFTER FIX):
```
Document → Chunks → Entity Extraction → Entity-Chunk Links → Storage
           ↓              ↓                    ↓
    Real Embeddings → Entities → Knowledge Graph → Semantic Search
```

## 🔧 Development Environment

### Setup:
```bash
cd /Users/bogdan/til/graph-rag-mcp
# Dependencies already installed
# Memgraph running on port 7777
# API configured for port 8888
```

### Testing Entity Extraction Fix:
```bash
# 1. Make your changes to ingestion.py
# 2. Test with existing data:
SYNAPSE_MEMGRAPH_PORT=7777 python analyze_knowledge_base.py

# 3. Should see entities extracted
# 4. Test with new document:
echo '{"path": "test.md", "content": "Apple Inc. is a technology company in Cupertino.", "metadata": {}}' | \
SYNAPSE_MEMGRAPH_PORT=7777 uv run python -m graph_rag.cli.commands.store --stdin --embeddings --replace
```

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### DO NOT:
- Change the port configuration (8888/7777)
- Break existing working functionality
- Modify the analysis tools (they work correctly)
- Change the basic document ingestion pipeline

### DO:
- Focus on the entity extraction integration in IngestionService
- Test changes incrementally
- Verify entity extraction with analysis tools
- Keep commits small and focused
- Fix one issue at a time

### If You Get Stuck:
1. **Entity extraction not called** - Look for missing method call in `ingest_document()`
2. **Circular imports** - Simplify import dependencies or create interface abstractions
3. **SpaCy model issues** - Verify model installation: `python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm`
4. **No entities found** - Check if extraction is actually being called and entities are being stored

## 🚀 Getting Started Checklist

1. [ ] Read this handoff document completely
2. [ ] Check current system state with `analyze_knowledge_base.py`
3. [ ] Examine `graph_rag/services/ingestion.py` for missing entity extraction
4. [ ] Identify where to add entity extraction call
5. [ ] Implement entity extraction integration
6. [ ] Test with analysis tools
7. [ ] Verify entities are being extracted and stored
8. [ ] Move to vector embedding fixes
9. [ ] Complete remaining data ingestion

## 📋 Verification Steps

After implementing entity extraction fix:

1. **Verify entities are extracted:**
   ```bash
   SYNAPSE_MEMGRAPH_PORT=7777 python analyze_knowledge_base.py
   # Should show > 0 entities
   ```

2. **Check entity types distribution:**
   ```bash
   # Should show various entity types (PERSON, ORG, GPE, etc.)
   ```

3. **Test entity-chunk relationships:**
   ```bash
   # Should show MENTIONS relationships between entities and chunks
   ```

4. **Validate with new document:**
   ```bash
   # Test ingestion of a new document with known entities
   ```

**Your mission is critical:** Fix the entity extraction to unlock the full knowledge graph value proposition. The infrastructure is solid - you just need to connect the pieces that are already there but not being used.

Good luck! 🚀
