## Documentation Cleanup Status (Updated)

**Recently Cleaned Up:**
- ✅ `docs/BACKLOG.md` - Removed completed [DONE] items, reorganized by priority
- ✅ `README.md` - Fixed incorrect repository URLs, updated CLI examples, added business intelligence context
- ✅ `CLAUDE.md` - Added consolidation status and import path guidance

**Confirmed Active Files (DO NOT DELETE):**
- `CLAUDE.md` - **ACTIVE** primary development guidance (NOT superseded by docs/HANDBOOK.md)
- Business development modules - Core $555K pipeline functionality
- docs/PLAN.md, docs/PROMPT.md - Strategic planning and implementation guidance

**Actual Deletion Candidates:**

**Severely Outdated Files:**
- `docs/development/SYSTEM_STATUS.md` - Contains incorrect metrics and future dates (Aug 2025)
- `docs/development/CLAUDE.md` - Duplicate of main CLAUDE.md but outdated version
- `memory-bank/active-context.md` - Outdated context from different development phase

**Empty/Legacy Directories:** (if still present after development)
- `handlers/` (if empty)
- `middleware/` (if empty) 
- Legacy `graphrag/` namespace (if unused)

**Before Deletion Process:**
1. Verify no active references with: `rg -n "SYSTEM_STATUS|active-context"`
2. Ensure no critical business logic in candidate files
3. Run full test suite: `make test`
4. Update any linking documentation
