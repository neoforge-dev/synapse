# Save each as: content-strategist.md, bogdan-voice.md, etc.

# 3. Verify agents are available
claude
> /agents
# Should show all your content production agents

# 4. Test Synapse integration
> Use content-strategist to analyze my LinkedIn performance data from Synapse
```

### **Example Output Structure**:
```markdown
🎯 Why Your First 10 Engineering Hires Define Your Company Culture

Controversial take: Your startup's culture isn't built by mission statements or company values. It's built by engineers #1-10.

Here's what I learned scaling teams from 5 to 30+ developers across gaming, healthcare, and fintech:

Engineer #1-3: The Foundation
• They set the technical bar
• Define "good enough" vs "perfect"
• Establish communication patterns

Engineer #4-7: The Multipliers
• Either reinforce or challenge the foundation
• Create the first sub-teams
• Set collaboration standards

Engineer #8-10: The Culture Lock
• By now, patterns are set
• New hires adapt or leave
• Culture becomes self-reinforcing

Real example from my healthcare startup experience:
[Specific story about early hiring at Specta.AI]

The $1M mistake most founders make:
Hiring for skills over culture fit in positions 1-10.

My framework for early engineering hires:
1. [Specific actionable framework]
2. [Based on real experience]
3. [With measurable outcomes]

What's your take on early hiring? Does culture trump skills?
